<noinput>
8. Output:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen.

In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll molecules in the plant's chloroplasts absorb sunlight and convert it into usable energy (ATP and NADPH). In the Calvin cycle, this energy is used along with carbon dioxide to produce glucose, a sugar that serves as an energy source for the plant, and release oxygen as a byproduct.
