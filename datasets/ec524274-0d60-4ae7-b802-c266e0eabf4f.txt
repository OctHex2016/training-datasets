<noinput>

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and select bacteria convert light energy, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O) into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen (O2).

Through a series of chemical reactions within the chloroplasts known as the light-dependent and light-independent reactions, sunlight is used to convert CO2 and H2O into glucose, which serves as the plant's energy source, and O2, which becomes a byproduct released into the atmosphere.
