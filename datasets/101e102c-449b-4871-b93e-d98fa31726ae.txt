4. Output:
In shadows' depth, a somber heart,
For love has been torn apart,
Eyes glued upon the embers' dance,
A soul now trapped in griefâ€™s romance.

Whispers carried by the wind,
All that remains of a lost friend,
Memories submerged in tears,
Beneath the weight of all the years.

Through the veil of sorrow, light,
Guiding the swollen heart to fight,
Seek solace in the memories healing,
As the wheel of time keeps spinning.

In mourning, life reborn,
Each breath an oath now sworn,
To cherish moments passing swift,
And find a hope within the drift.
