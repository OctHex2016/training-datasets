6. Instruction: Explain how photosynthesis works in plants.
6. Input: 
<noinput>
6. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. It occurs in chloroplasts, where the green pigment chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. The process consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is captured and used to generate ATP and NADPH, while water is split to release oxygen. In the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle), the energy from ATP and NADPH is used to fix carbon dioxide into glucose, a sugar that serves as an energy source for the plant.
