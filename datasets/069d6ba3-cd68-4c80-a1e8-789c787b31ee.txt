<noinput>
7. Output:
In Autumn's gripping grasp, the trees transform,
From greens of summer, reds and golds they swarm.
A fiery dance upon the forest floor,
A season's timely end, yet we adore.

The air turns cool, crisp whispers in the breeze,
A harmony of rustling, singing leaves.
A symphony composed by nature's hand,
The fleeting beauty, drawing to an end.

Though daylight wanes, we cherish autumn's hues,
And cling to every moment we peruse.
For winter nears with silence in its wake,
Leaving memories of the beauty that we take.
