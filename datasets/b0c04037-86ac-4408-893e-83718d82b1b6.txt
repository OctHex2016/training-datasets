4. Instruction: Explain the connection between climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.
4. Input: 
<noinput>
4. Output: 
Greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from human activities like the burning of fossil fuels, agriculture, and deforestation, contribute to climate change by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. The main greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases. As the concentration of these gases increases, they intensify the natural greenhouse effect, leading to a rise in global temperatures. This, in turn, results in a range of impacts such as more frequent and severe weather events, sea level rise, ocean acidification, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture.
