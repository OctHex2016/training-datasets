The sun had set and the sky was painted with hues of pink and orange as Emily and Jack walked along the beach. They had met here years ago, and this was their favorite spot for a sunset walk. As they walked along, Jack took Emily's hand and stopped suddenly. "There's something I've been wanting to ask you," he said, getting down on one knee. "Will you marry me?" Emily gasped and tears filled her eyes as she whispered "yes". The sky seemed to light up with fireworks as they shared a sweet kiss.
