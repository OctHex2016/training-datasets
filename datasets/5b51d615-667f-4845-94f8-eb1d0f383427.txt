20. Instruction: Can you give me a brief explanation of how a car engine works? 
20. Input: 
<noinput>
20. Output: 
A car engine works by converting the potential energy stored in fuel into kinetic energy, which is used to power the vehicle. The engine is made up of several parts, including the crankshaft, piston, cylinder, and fuel injector, that work together to perform this process. When the fuel and air mix in the engine's combustion chamber, it creates an explosion that propels the engine's pistons. These pistons, in turn, move the crankshaft to create rotational motion, which is transferred to the wheels of the car.
