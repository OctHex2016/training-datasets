5. Instruction: Write a poem about the picture provided.
5. Input: 
A majestic oak tree with deep roots in a quiet, green meadow.
5. Output: 
In the meadow green and wide,
Stands a tree with roots that bide,
A mighty oak so grand and tall,
With leaves that whisper in the wind's thrall.

The sun's rays peek through the boughs,
Where squirrels leap and birds carouse,
In tranquil shade, life's ebb and flow,
Long has the oak stood, and ages witnessed go.

With sprawling roots, it clings to earth,
In silent witness to life's birth,
A sentinel of nature's grace,
Amidst the quiet, green embrace.
