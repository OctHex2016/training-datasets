###
20. Instruction: Explain the process of photosynthesis.
20. Input: 
<noinput>
20. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. In this process, light energy (from the sun) is absorbed by chlorophyll, a pigment found in the cells' chloroplasts. The absorbed energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide (taken from the atmosphere) and water (absorbed by the roots) into glucose and oxygen. The glucose serves as an energy source for the plant, while the oxygen is released as a byproduct.
