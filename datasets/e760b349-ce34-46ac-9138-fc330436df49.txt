Lost in a dense forest, Sarah stumbled upon a seemingly abandoned cabin. Gasping for breath, she entered, seeking shelter from the darkness outside. The thick layer of dust covering the furniture told stories of a forgotten past. As she explored the cabin, she found several strange paintings with unsettling, hidden faces. Driven by curiosity, she pressed a crooked painting against the wall, and to her surprise, it revealed a secret door.

The eerie secret room contained an old diary. She opened it, and her heart sank. The handwritten notes described her life, her own secrets, and her fears in excruciating detail, as if the cabin had been waiting for her. With her heart pounding, she glanced up from the diary, only to see her reflection in a mirror, bearing soulless eyes and a sinister grin. It was then, she realized the twisted truth; she herself was the horror lurking in the cabin - a malevolent spirit, forever trapped within its walls.
