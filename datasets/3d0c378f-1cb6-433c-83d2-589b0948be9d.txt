Alligators and crocodiles are both large reptiles, but they belong to different families.

Crocodiles are typically more aggressive than alligators, and their habitat also varies: alligators are mostly found in freshwater environments like swamps, while crocodiles inhabit brackish and saltwater areas. Additionally, when their mouths are closed, alligators' lower teeth are hidden, whereas the lower teeth of crocodiles are visible.
