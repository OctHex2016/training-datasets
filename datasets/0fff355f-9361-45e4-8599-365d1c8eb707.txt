10. Instruction: Write a brief analysis of GDP and its limitations as a measure of economic well-being.
10. Input: 
<noinput>
10. Output: 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the total value of goods and services produced by a country over a specific time period. Although it is widely used to measure a country's economic health, it has some limitations. GDP does not account for factors such as income inequality, environmental impacts, unpaid domestic work, or quality of life. Additionally, GDP growth can be misleading if it is driven by unproductive or even harmful activities, such as excessive military spending or the cleanup of environmental disasters. Therefore, relying solely on GDP as an indicator of economic well-being can give an incomplete and unbalanced picture of a country's progress.
