4. Instruction: Describe the life cycle of a butterfly in four distinct stages.

4. Input:
<noinput>

4. Output:
The life cycle of a butterfly comprises four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. First, the female butterfly lays eggs on a host plant. These eggs hatch into larvae, or caterpillars, which consume the host plant for nourishment. As they grow, they shed their old skin and transition through several instar stages. Eventually, the caterpillar forms a protective shell, called a chrysalis, and enters the pupa stage. Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis and transforms into an adult butterfly. Finally, the adult butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, ready to mate and continue the cycle.
