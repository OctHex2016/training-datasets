8. Instruction: Name and describe the four stages of the product life cycle.
8. Input: 
<noinput>
8. Output: 
1. Introduction Stage: In this stage, the product is newly launched in the market. It is characterized by limited sales, high production and marketing costs, and relatively low competition. The goal in this stage is to create awareness and establish a market presence.

2. Growth Stage: The growth stage is marked by a rapid increase in sales and market share. During this phase, the product gains customer acceptance and establishes a strong position in the market. Competition may also increase as new entrants see the potential in the product category. The focus during this stage is on expanding the market and increasing profitability.

3. Maturity Stage: In the maturity stage, sales growth slows down, and the product reaches its peak market share. As competition intensifies, companies may focus on maintaining market share, differentiating their products, and improving efficiency to maintain profitability. There could be a strong emphasis on marketing activities to retain customers and win over new ones.

4. Decline Stage: The decline stage is characterized by a decrease in sales and market share. This can be due to several factors such as market saturation, the emergence of new technologies, or changing consumer preferences. In this stage, companies may decide to discontinue the product, reduce costs to maintain profitability, or attempt to rejuvenate the product through innovation or rebranding.
