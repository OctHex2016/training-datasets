6. Instruction: What are the causes of global warming?
6. Input: 
<noinput>
6. Output:
The primary causes of global warming are human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural practices. Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Deforestation contributes by reducing the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide. Agricultural practices, particularly livestock farming, release methane, another potent greenhouse gas. These greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a gradual increase in global temperatures.

17. Input:
<noinput>
17. Output:
Photosynthesis is a process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O) into glucose (a form of sugar) and oxygen. The glucose provides energy for the plant's metabolic activities, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. This process occurs in the chloroplasts, organelles within plant cells containing the green pigment chlorophyll, which absorbs sunlight and drives the chemical reactions involved in photosynthesis.

19. Input:
<noinput>
19. Output:
Renewable energy sources are those that can be naturally replenished in a relatively short period of time, such as solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal energy. These sources are considered environmentally friendly and sustainable in the long term. Non-renewable energy sources are those that are finite and deplete over time due to human consumption, like fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and nuclear energy (uranium). These sources are not sustainable because they take millions of years to form and emit greenhouse gases and pollutants when used.
