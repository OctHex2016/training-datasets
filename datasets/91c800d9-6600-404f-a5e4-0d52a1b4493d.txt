12. Instruction: Present a brief introduction about the life of Isaac Newton.
12. Input: 
<noinput>
12. Output: 
Isaac Newton, an influential English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer, was born on January 4, 1643, and died on March 31, 1727. He is best known for developing the universal law of gravitation and the three laws of motion, which laid the foundation for classical physics. In addition, Newton invented calculus independently from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, leading to a long-standing controversy between the two mathematicians. Newton's book, "Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica," is considered one of the most important works in the history of science.

19. Instruction: Discuss the primary colors in painting and their importance.
19. Input: 
<noinput>
19. Output: 
The primary colors in painting are red, blue, and yellow. These colors are considered primary because they cannot be created by mixing other colors together. They hold great importance in art, as they are the basis of all other colors. By combining primary colors in different proportions, artists can create a wide range of colors and, consequently, a rich and diverse visual palette. Understanding and mastering primary colors provide artists with the foundation to create dynamic artwork and balance color harmony within their compositions.
