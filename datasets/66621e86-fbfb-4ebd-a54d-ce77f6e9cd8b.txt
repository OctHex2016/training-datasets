16. Input: 
<noinput>
16. Output: 
Photosynthesis is a biological process carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria. During photosynthesis, these organisms use the energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide absorbed from the air and water taken up from their environment into glucose (a form of sugar) and oxygen. The glucose is used to produce energy to sustain the organism's life processes, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. This process plays a crucial role in providing the necessary energy and air for life on Earth.
