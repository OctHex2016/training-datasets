<noinput>

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. In plants, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, which contain the chlorophyll necessary for capturing light. The process consists of two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). The light-dependent reactions use absorbed light to produce ATP and NADPH, while the Calvin cycle uses those molecules to convert CO2 into glucose.
