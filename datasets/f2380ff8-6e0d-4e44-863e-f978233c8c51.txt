9. Instruction: Interpret the dream in a psychological context.
9. Input: 
In my dream, I was walking through a densely forested area when I came across a bridge. The bridge was old and rickety, but I decided to cross it anyway. As I started crossing, beneath me, a river with fast-flowing currents became visible. Suddenly, the boards of the bridge began to break under my feet, and I had to desperately hold on to the bridge's railing to avoid falling into the water. Just as I thought I was about to fall into the river, I woke up.
9. Output: 
The dream may symbolize feelings of uncertainty or insecurity in your life. The forest represents the unknown, while the old, rickety bridge could signify a major decision or transition in your life. The fast-flowing river and breaking bridge boards convey a sense of being overwhelmed by external factors or emotions. Desperately holding onto the railing implies a desire to maintain control despite the instability around you. The dream may serve as a reminder to face your fears and find support during challenging times.
