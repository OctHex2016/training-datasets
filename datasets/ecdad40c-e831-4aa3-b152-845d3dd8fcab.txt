11. Instruction: Provide a scientific explanation for the given phenomenon.
11. Input: 
Why does the sun appear red during sunset?
11. Output: 
The sun appears red during sunset due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As the sun sets, sunlight travels a longer distance through the atmosphere, which causes short-wavelength light, such as blue and green, to scatter more. This leaves the longer-wavelength red and orange light to predominate as they are scattered less, making the sun appear red.
