4. Input: 
The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth and can grow up to 98 feet (30 meters) long and weigh as much as 200 tons (180 metric tons). Blue whales, despite their vast size, mostly feed on small shrimp-like creatures called krill. A single adult blue whale can eat about 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg) of krill during one day. These gentle giants are mostly found in the open ocean, where they communicate in distinctive low-frequency sounds. They are known for their impressive acrobatics, often involving breaching and jumping out of the water. Unfortunately, blue whales were once hunted to the brink of extinction, and their populations are still recovering today.
4. Output: 
The blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, feeds primarily on krill and is known for its acrobatics in the ocean. They were once heavily hunted and are still recovering their population numbers.
