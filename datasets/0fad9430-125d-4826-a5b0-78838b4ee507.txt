The internet has been one of the greatest innovations of the 21st century, but it has also brought many drawbacks. Although the internet makes it easier to access information and to communicate with people across the world, it also presents new challenges. One of these challenges is cyberbullying, which has become a severe problem in recent years. Cyberbullying can have devastating effects on the mental health of those affected, leading to depression, anxiety, and even suicide. The anonymity provided by the internet makes it easier for bullies to cause harm without facing the consequences of their actions. Furthermore, the widespread nature of social media means that cyberbullying can easily reach a large audience, with the victim's humiliation being amplified by the number of people who see it.
