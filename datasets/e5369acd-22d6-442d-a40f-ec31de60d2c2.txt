I am writing to express my dissatisfaction regarding my recent order (Order Number: ######) placed on [date]. I was eagerly awaiting my parcel, but sadly, it has not arrived within the stipulated delivery time.

I kindly request that you promptly investigate this matter and provide an update on the whereabouts of my parcel. If the items cannot be located, I expect a full refund or replacement to be sent without delay.

I look forward to your swift resolution of this issue. Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
