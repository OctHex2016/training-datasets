11. Instruction: Summarize the main points of the following text in a bullet point list.
11. Input: 
The Arctic Fox population has been negatively impacted by climate change. As the snow and ice melt, it becomes more difficult for these foxes to find food and shelter. This is because their primary prey, lemmings, has been declining due to changes in vegetation brought about by global warming. Additionally, the Arctic Fox's camouflage strategy, which relies on its white fur to blend in with the snow, becomes less effective as the snow diminishes. Furthermore, increased competition from larger predators, such as the red fox, puts the Arctic Fox population at risk. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of this species, such as monitoring their population, managing their habitat, and limiting human disturbances.
11. Output: 
- Arctic Fox population negatively impacted by climate change.
- Difficult to find food and shelter due to declining lemmings and melting ice/snow.
- Camouflage strategy less effective.
- Increased competition from larger predators like red foxes.
