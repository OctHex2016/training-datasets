4. Instruction: Write a brief summary of the given article.
4. Input:
Scientists have recently discovered an Earth-like exoplanet named TOI-1231 b, which is located 90 light-years away from our solar system. The planet orbits around an M-class dwarf star and has a temperate climate due to its distance from the star, making it a possible candidate for future exploration. The atmosphere of TOI-1231 b is believed to contain significant amounts of water vapor, adding to the intrigue of the find. Researchers also hope that the planetâ€™s proximity to Earth will facilitate opportunities for further study and understanding of its composition and climate, potentially providing insights into the evolution of the exoplanetary atmosphere.
