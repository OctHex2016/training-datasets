14. Instruction: Explain the concept of supply and demand with an example.
14. Input: 
<noinput>
14. Output: 
The concept of supply and demand refers to the relationship between the availability of a good or service (supply) and the desire for that good or service among consumers (demand). When supply and demand are in balance, the price of a good or service will be stable. However, when supply is low and demand is high, the price of the good or service will rise, while a surplus of the good or service will lead to lower prices. For example, during a heatwave, the demand for air conditioners will increase, and stores may increase the price of air conditioners to balance supply and demand.
