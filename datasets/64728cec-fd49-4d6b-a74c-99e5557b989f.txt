The researchers created a special fabric that can hold up to 30 times its weight in oil without absorbing water. These innovative fabric sponges can be easily wrung out to recover the oil and are reusable. Current oil spill cleanup methods such as skimming and dispersion can harm the environment; however, this new sponge-like fabric can help minimize the ecological impact of oil spills, offering a more environmentally friendly solution.
