Nature is a marvelous thing,
The birds and trees that sweetly sing,
The flowers that bloom in the spring,
And the gentle breeze on my window's ring.

The fields of green stretch as far as the eye can see,
The mountains majestic, standing proud and free,
The ocean waves crashing against the shore,
The sunset that takes my breath, and leaves me wanting more.

Nature is a thing to be cherished and loved,
For its beauty is a gift, sent from above.
So take a moment to appreciate its splendor,
And feel your soul with joy surrender.
