4. Instruction: Identify the logical fallacy in the statement below and explain why it is a fallacy.
4. Input: 
My friend says that since millions of people are signing up for the new social media platform, it must be good.
4. Output: 
The statement contains the "bandwagon fallacy," which asserts that a belief or action is valid because many people believe or engage in it. Though millions of people signing up for the platform indicate its popularity, it doesn't necessarily mean that the platform is good or worthwhile. The argument relies on the assumption that a popular choice is inherently a good choice, which is not always true.

6. Instruction: Calculate the monthly payment for a loan of $25,000 with an annual interest rate of 6% and a loan term of 5 years. Use the formula: M = P * (r * (1 + r)^n) / (((1 + r)^n) - 1).
6. Input:
<noinput>
6. Output:
The loan amount (P) is $25,000, the annual interest rate (r) is 0.06 (6%), and the loan term (n) is 5 years or 60 months. Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate by dividing by 12: r = 0.06 / 12 = 0.005.

Now, apply the formula: M = 25000 * (0.005 * (1 + 0.005)^60) / (((1 + 0.005)^60) - 1).

After evaluating the formula, M ≈ $483.32. Therefore, the monthly payment for the loan is approximately $483.32.
