The U.S. FDA approved a new drug called Aduhelm, developed by Biogen, as the first treatment to slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients in June 2021. Although Aduhelm was initially met with enthusiasm, controversy quickly arose about its cost and effectiveness. The drug's annual cost is over $56,000 per patient, putting a significant financial burden on families and healthcare systems. Additionally, several studies yielded conflicting results on Aduhelm's effectiveness, leading to divided opinions among medical professionals. Due to limited availability, some patients are traveling to other states to get the drug, while several major hospitals in the U.S. have decided not to offer Aduhelm at this time.
