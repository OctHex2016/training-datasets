<noinput>

Recycling is important because it conserves resources, saves energy, reduces pollution, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and preserves landfill space. By recycling, we decrease the demand for new raw materials, which in turn reduces deforestation and habitat loss. Additionally, recycling reduces the energy required to produce, transport, and process new materials, which results in lower carbon emissions. Recycling also reduces waste in landfills, which can lead to groundwater contamination and other detrimental environmental effects.
