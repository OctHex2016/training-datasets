9. Instruction: Can you paraphrase this news article? 
9. Input: 
Article title: "Study shows that students who take notes on paper perform better on tests than those who use laptops"
Article text: A new study reveals that students who take handwritten class notes perform better than students who use a laptop for note-taking.

The study, from Princeton University and the University of California at Los Angeles, compared the performance of students who took notes on paper versus their laptop-using counterparts. Results showed that students who took notes by hand remembered lecture content at a significantly higher rate, particularly when it came to conceptual questions.

The researchers hypothesize that taking notes on a laptop encourages students to transcribe lectures verbatim, while handwriting notes allows students to process information and reframe it in their own words, leading to better retention and understanding.

Despite the prevalence and convenience of laptop use in the classroom, the study shows that when it comes to retaining information, it may be worth it for students to stick with old-fashioned pen and paper.

9. Output:
According to a new study from researchers at Princeton University and the University of California, students who take notes by hand rather than on a laptop perform better on tests. The researchers found that handwriting notes allows students to better process and reframe information, leading to better retention and understanding. While laptops are more common in classrooms, students may benefit from sticking to pen and paper for better academic performance.
