20. Instruction: Provide a concise explanation of the Doppler effect.
20. Input: 
<noinput>
20. Output: 
The Doppler effect is a phenomenon in which the observed frequency of a wave changes when the source of the wave and the observer are in relative motion. For example, when a moving source of sound approaches an observer, the frequency of the sound waves heard by the observer increases, resulting in a higher pitch. Conversely, when the source moves away from the observer, the frequency decreases, leading to a lower pitch. This effect is also observed in electromagnetic waves, such as visible light, leading to redshift or blueshift.
