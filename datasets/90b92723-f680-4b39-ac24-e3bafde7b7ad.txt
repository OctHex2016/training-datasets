4. Instruction: In plain language, summarize the main point of the following text passage.
4. Input: 
Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when individuals experience a mental discomfort caused by trying to hold two or more incompatible beliefs, attitudes, or values at the same time. The phenomenon was first identified by psychologist Leon Festinger as he studied the behavior and thoughts of individuals in a doomsday cult. He observed that when the prophesized end of the world did not occur, cult members coped with their cognitive dissonance by convincing themselves that their faith had saved the world from destruction.
4. Output: 
Cognitive dissonance happens when people feel mental discomfort from trying to hold conflicting beliefs or attitudes at once. It was first discovered by psychologist Leon Festinger while studying a doomsday cult, whose members changed their beliefs to deal with the dissonance when their prediction didn't come true.

Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and some algae to convert light energy, primarily from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. It involves the absorption of carbon dioxide and water, which are converted into glucose and oxygen using the energy from sunlight. Chlorophyll, found in the cells of plant leaves, plays a vital role in capturing light energy for this process.

This style is more concerned with achieving short-term goals and maintaining the status quo rather than inspiring long-term development and change.
