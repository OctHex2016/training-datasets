Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. It occurs in chloroplasts, the plant cells' organelles containing chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, light-dependent reactions absorb sunlight, generating ATP and NADPH. In the light-independent (Calvin) cycle, these energy molecules, along with carbon dioxide, are used to produce glucose, which serves as an energy source for the plant, and oxygen is released as a byproduct.

20. Instruction: State the advantages and disadvantages of using nuclear energy as a power source.
