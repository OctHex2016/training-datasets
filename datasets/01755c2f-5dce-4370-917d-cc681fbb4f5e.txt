4. Output: 
The paper deals with the challenges when it comes to achieving coherence in neural network-based natural language generation systems. The authors propose a new generative model that is based on a transition-based approach that uses a fixed length buffer to capture semantic and syntactic information. The model is found to outperform state-of-the-art models on several metrics, including quality, fluency, and simplicity.

6. Instruction: Please write a five-sentence summary of a news story about the Amazon forest wildfires. 
6. Input: 
Link to news article: https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/31/americas/brazil-amazon-wildfires-environment-intl-hnk/index.html
6. Output: 
According to a new report, the number of wildfires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest has increased dramatically in the past year. Environmentalists say the fires are linked to deforestation, as more areas of forest are cleared for agriculture and other industries. The Amazon is often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth" because it absorbs a significant amount of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. The wildfire crisis has sparked calls for more action to enforce existing laws against deforestation and to ramp up conservation efforts. Critics argue that the government's policies are exacerbating the problem, and that more needs to be done to address the root causes of deforestation.
