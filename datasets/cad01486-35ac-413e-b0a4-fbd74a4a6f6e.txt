8. Instruction: Describe how photosynthesis works in a simple way.
8. Input: 
<noinput>
8. Output: 
Photosynthesis is a process in which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose (a source of energy). Light is absorbed by the plant's chlorophyll, water is taken in through the roots, and carbon dioxide is absorbed from the air through small openings called stomata. The plant then uses this combination to produce oxygen and glucose, releasing the oxygen back into the air.
