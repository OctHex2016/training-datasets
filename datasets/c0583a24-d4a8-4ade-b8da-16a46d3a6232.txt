4. Input: 
Original argument: Wearing uniforms in school helps to build a sense of unity and equality among students and reduces bullying rates.
4. Output: 
Counterargument: While uniforms may help promote unity and reduce bullying in schools, they can also stifle creativity and self-expression among students. Allowing students to choose their own clothing encourages them to explore their individuality, and it can be a means of fostering a more diverse, accepting school environment. Furthermore, enforcing a uniform policy may create an additional financial burden on families, particularly those with limited resources. Schools may consider adopting a more flexible dress code policy that still maintains a standard of modesty and decency, while allowing students to express their unique personalities.
