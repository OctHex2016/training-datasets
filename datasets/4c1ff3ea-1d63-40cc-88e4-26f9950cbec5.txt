Whales are the biggest animals on Earth today. They evolved from land-dwelling animals related to the hippopotamus that lived around 50 million years ago. The two main types of modern whales are toothed whales and baleen whales. Toothed whales, such as orcas and sperm whales, have teeth for hunting and feed primarily on fish and squid. Baleen whales, on the other hand, like blue whales and humpback whales, have baleen plates that enable them to filter-feed on tiny krill and small fish present in massive quantities in the ocean.
