Vast and endless, the sky above,
Holds a beauty seen by few.
Of twinkling stars and shimmering light,
Guiding us through the night.

Owls soaring, taking flight.
Silent whispers circle 'round,
And in the distance, wolves oh so loud.

The mysteries of the universe,
Folded neatly into a single verse.
A night sky, canvas to the soul,
A place to ponder, to be whole.
