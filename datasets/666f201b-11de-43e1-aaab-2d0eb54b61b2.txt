14. Instruction: Explain a fundamental concept in a concise and understandable way.
14. Input:
Concept: Time dilation in Einstein's theory of relativity
14. Output:
Time dilation is a phenomenon in Einstein's theory of relativity where time passes at different rates for two observers depending on their relative velocity or the presence of a gravitational field. This means that the faster an object is traveling or the stronger the gravitational field it's in, the slower time will pass for it compared to a stationary observer or one experiencing weaker gravity. In essence, time dilation demonstrates that time is not absolute, but relative to the observer.
