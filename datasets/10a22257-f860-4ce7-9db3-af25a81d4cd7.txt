The effects of climate change are becoming more evident as time goes on. An increased frequency of storms and severe weather events has cost millions of dollars in damage worldwide. Additionally, sea levels are rising at an alarming rate, creating problems for coastal communities as well as affecting local ecosystems. The melting of polar ice caps has also contributed to rising sea levels, with alarming consequences for marine wildlife.

Efforts to combat climate change are currently underway. Nations and governments are collaborating to create policies and regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions, such as the Paris Agreement. Organizations like the United Nations and various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also devising strategies to help combat deforestation and promote the use of renewable energy sources.
