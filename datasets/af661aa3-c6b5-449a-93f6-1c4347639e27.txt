<noinput>
12. Output: 
Begin by boiling water and grinding coffee beans to a medium-fine consistency. Place a filter into the pour-over dripper, and rinse with hot water to eliminate any paper taste. Add the coffee grounds (use 1:15 coffee-to-water ratio) into the filter and level the surface. Put the dripper on top of your mug. Slowly pour just enough hot water (approx 195-205°F) to cover and saturate the grounds, allowing them to bloom for about 30 seconds. Continue pouring hot water in a circular motion, wetting whole area of coffee grounds while avoiding the filter edges. Let the water flow through the filter, wait a few seconds, and repeat the process. Once the desired amount of brewed coffee has been collected, remove the dripper from your mug, dispose of the grounds and filter, and enjoy your coffee.
