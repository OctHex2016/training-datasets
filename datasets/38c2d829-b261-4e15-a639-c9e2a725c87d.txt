4. Instruction: Write a brief summary of the given text.
4. Input: 
The European Society of Cardiology shared new research findings on the benefits of walking for older adults. The study claims that taking a 30-minute walk daily can dramatically decrease your risk of heart failure. The researchers monitored more than 1,000 participants aged 60 and older for 13 years, gathering data around their physical activity, lifestyle habits, medical histories, and socio-economic factors. Even after accounting for other factors, regular walkers were found to have a 73% lower risk of heart failure as compared to non-walkers.
4. Output: 
A study by the European Society of Cardiology has found that older adults who take a daily 30-minute walk can substantially reduce their risk of heart failure. With over 1,000 participants aged 60 and older, the 13-year research shows that regular walkers have a 73% lower risk compared to non-walkers, even after considering other factors.

5. Instruction: Explain the concept of classical conditioning in simple words.
5. Input:
<noinput>
5. Output:
Classical conditioning is a learning process where an individual associates a neutral stimulus with a significant stimulus. Gradually, they react to the neutral stimulus as they would to the significant one. It was first studied by the Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov, who discovered that dogs would start to salivate when they saw a stimulus, like a lab assistant or lab equipment, associated with being fed, even if there was no food present.

6. Instruction: Compare and contrast solar energy and wind energy.
6. Input:
<noinput>
6. Output:
Solar energy and wind energy are both clean, renewable sources of power. Solar energy harnesses sunlight using solar panels or photovoltaic cells, while wind energy captures the kinetic power of wind with the help of wind turbines. Both help to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Major differences between them include the variability of their sources: solar energy depends on sunlight and can only generate electricity during the daytime, whereas wind energy is available both day and night. Additionally, solar panels can be installed on rooftops, making them ideal for urban and suburban areas, whereas wind turbines require large areas of land, and are often found in rural areas.7. Instruction: Translate the given sentence from English to French.

With concerns about climate change and the depletion of fossil fuel resources, more people are turning to electric vehicles as an environmentally-friendly alternative. Electric cars not only help conserve valuable natural resources, but they also reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This shift to electric vehicles helps to support the goal of developing a more sustainable future.
8. Output:
