5. Post-test: Administer the same memory test to both groups at the end of the two-week period. Record each score.

6. Data analysis: Compare the pre- and post-test scores, calculating the average change in memory performance for each group. Use a t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in memory improvement between the caffeine group and the control group.
