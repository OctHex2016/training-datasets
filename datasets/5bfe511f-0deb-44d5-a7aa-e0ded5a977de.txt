Hi team, 

I have reached out to the restaurant and they confirmed that our reservation for the meeting scheduled on Wednesday will be for 3 pm. Just a reminder, we are planning to be there at 3 pm on Wednesday.
Please let me know if there are any issues with the timing or with our reservation.

Best,
Dave
