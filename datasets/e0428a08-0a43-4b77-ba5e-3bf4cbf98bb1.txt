15. Instruction: Explain how photosynthesis works in plants.
15. Input:
<noinput>
15. Output:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth. It occurs mainly in the leaves, where specialized cells called chloroplasts absorb sunlight. Photosynthesis consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).

During the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll (a pigment inside chloroplasts) absorbs light energy and uses it to split water molecules, producing oxygen gas and energy-rich molecules (ATP and NADPH). The oxygen is released as a byproduct.

In the light-independent reactions, the Calvin cycle takes place, which uses the energy from ATP and NADPH, along with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, to synthesize glucose (a sugar) and other organic molecules. These products serve as the building blocks for the plant's growth and repair and are also a food source for other living organisms.16. Instruction: Translate this text from English to French.
