4. Output: 
Under moonlit skies abounding,
Stars like diamonds, heavens surrounding,
Two hearts in luminous embrace,
Eyes that glimmer, reflect starlit grace.

Waltzing within celestial glow,
Silent whispers, feelings bestow,
Love ebbs and flows like tidal force,
Infinite vastness, a celestial course.

Illuminated by Luna's tender light,
Our love resembles the cosmos' sight,
Boundless, eternal, and shining bright,
The moon and stars, our souls' delight.
