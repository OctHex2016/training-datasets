4. Instruction: Describe how the process of photosynthesis works.
4. Input: 
<noinput>
4. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. It occurs mainly in the chloroplasts within plant cells. The process involves two main steps: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, and water molecules are split, releasing oxygen and producing ATP (energy-carrying molecule) and NADPH (electron carrier). During the light-independent reactions, carbon dioxide is fixed into glucose using the energy from ATP and NADPH.
