20. Instruction: Explain the basic principle behind the flight of an airplane.
20. Input:
<noinput>
20. Output:
The basic principle behind the flight of an airplane is the generation of lift by its wings. This lift is produced due to the difference in air pressure created by the shape of the wing - the airfoil. As the airplane moves forward, the air flows faster over the curved upper surface of the wing, creating a low-pressure area above, and slower under the flatter lower surface, creating high pressure below. This pressure difference generates lift, overcoming gravity and allowing the airplane to fly.
