Polar bears, also known as Ursus maritimus, are large carnivorous bears found in the Arctic regions. Due to their thick layers of fur and blubber, they are well-suited to the frigid environment they inhabit. Polar bears primarily hunt seals, using their strong sense of smell to locate breathing holes in the ice where seals come up for air. As apex predators, they play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance. However, climate change and shrinking sea ice has adversely affected their habitat and food availability, making their conservation a key concern.
