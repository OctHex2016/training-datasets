4. Output: 
Aerobic respiration requires oxygen and produces a large amount of energy in the form of ATP. It occurs in three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. The end products are carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Anaerobic respiration, on the other hand, does not require oxygen and produces less energy. It occurs through two types: alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. The end products can be ethanol and carbon dioxide in alcoholic fermentation, or lactic acid in lactic acid fermentation.
