School uniforms should be mandatory for students as they promote a sense of belonging, equality, and unity among the school community. Wearing uniforms helps reduce social stratification and peer pressure by eliminating the perpetual competition of trying to outdo each other with the latest fashion trends or expensive clothing. Uniforms also simplify daily routines, saving time and effort spent on choosing outfits each day. Moreover, schools with uniforms often foster an environment where students can focus on their studies, with fewer distractions from comparing appearances. Ultimately, mandatory school uniforms contribute to a focused, inclusive, and cohesive educational environment.
