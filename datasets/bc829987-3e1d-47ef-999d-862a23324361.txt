4. Input: 
A new study has found that people with higher levels of education are less likely to experience memory loss as they age. The study, published in the journal Neurology, analyzed data from over 15,000 participants over the age of 45. The researchers found that those who had completed at least one year of college were 45% less likely to experience memory loss than those who had not completed high school. The results suggest that education is a protective factor against memory loss.
