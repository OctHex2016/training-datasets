Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost

Whose woods these are I think I know. 
His house is in the village, though; 
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow. 

My little horse must think it queer 
To stop without a farmhouse near 
Between the woods and frozen lake 
The darkest evening of the year. 

He gives his harness bells a shake 
To ask if there is some mistake. 
The only other sound's the sweep 
Of easy wind and downy flake. 

The woods are lovely, dark and deep, 
But I have promises to keep, 
And miles to go before I sleep, 
And miles to go before I sleep.

The main theme of the poem is the allure of nature's beauty and the struggle to balance it with one's duties and obligations.
