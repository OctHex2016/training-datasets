4. Instruction: Summarize the key points of the given paragraph.
4. Input: 
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that relies on cryptographic principles to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. It was created in 2009 by an anonymous programmer or group of programmers known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by a central authority, such as a government or central bank. Instead, transactions are verified and recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain, which is maintained by a network of computers called nodes. One of the main attractions of Bitcoin is its low transaction fees and fast processing times, as well as the anonymity it provides to its users.
