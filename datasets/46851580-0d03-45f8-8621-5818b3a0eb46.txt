12. Instruction: What is the fundamental theorem of calculus?
12. Input: 
<noinput>
12. Output: 
The fundamental theorem of calculus is a key theorem in mathematics that connects the concepts of differentiation and integration. It has two parts: 
1. The first part states that finding an indefinite integral (antiderivative) effectively reverses the differentiation process.
2. The second part states that definite integrals can be evaluated using antiderivatives, establishing a relationship between integral calculus and differential calculus.

16. Instruction: Explain polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP).
16. Input: 
<noinput>
16. Output: 
In object-oriented programming, polymorphism is a concept that allows objects from different classes to be treated as if they were objects from the same class. Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent various data types or classes and allows multiple functions or methods with the same name to perform different actions based on the type or number of arguments passed. This promotes code reusability, flexibility, and a more organized structure.

17. Instruction: List three potential risks when using public Wi-Fi and how to mitigate them.
17. Input: 
<noinput>
17. Output: 
1. Eavesdropping: Attackers can intercept sensitive data transmitted over public Wi-Fi. Mitigation: Use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your data.
2. Rogue hotspots: Cybercriminals can create fake Wi-Fi networks to deceive users. Mitigation: Verify the network name, and if possible, ask staff for the correct Wi-Fi network.
3. Malware infections: Public Wi-Fi can increase your device's vulnerability to malware. Mitigation: Keep your antivirus software updated and enable your device's firewall.

18. Instruction: Briefly describe the process of cellular respiration.
18. Input: 
<noinput>
18. Output: 
Cellular respiration is the process in which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy (adenosine triphosphate, ATP), carbon dioxide, and water. The process consists of three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain. During cellular respiration, glucose is broken down through various chemical reactions, which ultimately produce ATP, the energy currency for cells.
