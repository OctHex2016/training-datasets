4. Instruction: In a formal tone, describe the advantages and disadvantages of using electric cars over traditional gasoline cars.

4. Input:
<noinput>
4. Output:
Advantages:
1. Reduced emissions: Electric cars produce zero tailpipe emissions, which contributes to better air quality and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
2. Energy efficiency: Electric cars have a higher energy efficiency than gasoline-powered cars and generally require less energy for the same distance.
3. Low operating costs: The cost of electricity to power an electric vehicle is typically lower than the cost of gasoline, resulting in reduced fuel expenses.
4. Reduced noise pollution: Electric vehicles produce less noise than gasoline cars, which can lead to less noise pollution in urban environments.

Disadvantages:
1. Limited driving range: Electric vehicles have a shorter driving range compared to gasoline-powered cars, which could be an issue for long-distance journeys.
2. Charging infrastructure: The availability of charging stations is currently limited compared to the widespread network of gas stations, making long trips and remote area travel potentially complicated.
3. Longer refueling times: Charging an electric vehicle typically takes longer than filling up a gasoline tank, resulting in potentially longer wait times during road trips or peak charging hours.
4. High upfront cost: Electric vehicles can have higher initial costs than gasoline cars due to the costs associated with battery manufacturing.

<noinput>
6. Output:
To set up a chessboard, first, position the board so that a white square is in the bottom right corner for each player. Then, follow these steps to place the pieces:

1. Place the rooks on the two bottom corners of the board for each player (a1 and h1 for white, a8 and h8 for black).
2. Position the knights beside the rooks (b1 and g1 for white, b8 and g8 for black).
3. Put the bishops next to the knights (c1 and f1 for white, c8 and f8 for black).
4. Place the queen on the remaining square of her color (d1 for white, d8 for black).
5. Position the king on the last remaining square (e1 for white, e8 for black).
6. Finally, place the pawns on the second row (rank 2) for the white player and on the seventh row (rank 7) for the black player.

Now, the chessboard is properly set up and ready for a game.
