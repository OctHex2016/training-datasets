<noinput>

Go Fish is a simple card game played with a standard deck. The goal is to collect as many matching pairs of cards as possible. To start, each player is dealt 5 cards. Players take turns asking each other if they have a particular rank of card (e.g. "Do you have any 5's?"). If the player asks for a card and the other player has it they must give it to them. If a player collects a pair, they lay it down and get another turn. If the player asks for a card that the other player doesn't have, THEY "go fish" and draw a card from the deck. The game ends when all pairs have been collected and the player with the most pairs wins.
