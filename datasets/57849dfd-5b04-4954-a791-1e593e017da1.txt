"Do not go gentle into that good night" by Dylan Thomas is a powerful poem about the inevitability of death and the struggle against it. Thomas urges his readers, and implicitly his own father, to resist fading away and to fight for life to the very end. The poem's structure, a villanelle, reinforces its themes of persistence and resistance through the repetition of lines and the cyclical form. Overall, the poem delivers a message of urgency, hope, and determination in the face of life's greatest challenge: death.
