20. Instruction: Write a brief explanation of the greenhouse effect.
20. Input: 
<noinput>
20. Output: 
The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon that warms the Earth's surface. It occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane, trap heat radiated from the planet's surface. These gases, known as greenhouse gases, absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, preventing it from escaping into space. This process helps maintain a stable temperature on Earth, enabling life to thrive. However, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have increased greenhouse gas concentrations, intensifying the greenhouse effect, and leading to global warming.
