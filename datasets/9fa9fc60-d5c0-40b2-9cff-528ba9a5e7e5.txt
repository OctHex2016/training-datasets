7. Input: 
The European Union plans to unveil new climate proposals as part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions and achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement. Among the proposed measures is a carbon border tax, which would impose levies on imports of goods produced in countries with fewer climate restrictions. Critics of the plan argue that it could trigger trade disputes and be against World Trade Organization rules, while others see it as a necessary step in the global fight against climate change.
7. Output: 
The European Union is introducing new climate proposals to meet the Paris climate agreement goals, including a carbon border tax on goods imported from countries with less climate regulation. This tax could lead to trade disputes and potentially violate World Trade Organization rules. However, many view it as a crucial measure in the battle against climate change.

8. Instruction: Explain the concept of opportunity cost using at least two examples.
8. Input: 
<noinput>
8. Output:
Opportunity cost is defined as the value of the next best alternative that is forfeited when making a decision. For example, suppose you have $10,000 and must decide between investing in stocks or launching a small business. If you choose to invest in stocks and earn a 10% return, but your business would have earned a 20% return if started, your opportunity cost is the 10% return you missed out on by not starting the business. Another example, if you choose to spend an evening watching a movie instead of studying for an exam, the opportunity cost might be a lower exam score due to reduced study time.
