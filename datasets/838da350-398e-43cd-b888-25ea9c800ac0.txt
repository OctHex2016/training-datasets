5. Instruction: Summarize the input text in no more than 30 words.
5. Input:
Global warming is having a significant impact on Earth's ecosystems. The Polar Regions are particularly vulnerable, as rising temperatures are causing the glaciers to melt at an alarming rate. This, in turn, leads to rising sea levels and the loss of habitat for many species, such as the polar bear. Warmer temperatures are also causing a shift in global weather patterns, leading to more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and droughts. In order to mitigate these effects, it is essential that we take immediate action to reduce the production of greenhouse gases.
5. Output:
Global warming affects Earth's ecosystems, particularly the Polar Regions, causing glacier melting, rising sea levels, and habitat loss. It shifts weather patterns, leading to severe events. Immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas production is vital.
