Amidst the horizon's serene hue,
A masterpiece begins to ensue,
Golden rays paint the sky,
A canvas so vast, a dreamer's eye.

A celestial dance, a marvelous sync,
The sun descends, a soft slow embrace,

A fleeting moment, a heartfelt sigh,
As the day turns to twilight, the final ray,
A beautiful sunset, to end the day.
