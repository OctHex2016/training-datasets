9. Instruction: Please explain the Pythagorean theorem to a fifth grader. 
9. Input: 
<noinput>
9. Output: 
The Pythagorean theorem is a math formula that helps us find the length of a side of a right triangle when we know the lengths of the other two sides. It says that if we square the length of the short sides of a right triangle, and then add them together, we get the same number as if we squared the long side (also called the hypotenuse). Let's say the short sides of a right triangle are each 3 inches long. We would square each of those to get 9, and then add them together to get 18. We then take the square root of that, which is around 4.24. That means the hypotenuse would be around 4.24 inches long.

Ever-changing show 
A place of solace 
Where our spirits can grow 

So take my hand 
And let us walk 
Along the shore 
And hear the ocean talk 

For though it seems 
An endless gulf 
It speaks to us 
In gentle, rhythmic pulse

15. Instruction: Can you describe the process of photosynthesis? 
15. Input: 
<noinput>
15. Output: 
Photosynthesis is a process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. This chemical energy is stored in the form of glucose, a sugar that provides energy for the plant. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by pigments in the plant, which drives a series of chemical reactions. Water is split into oxygen, which is released into the atmosphere, and hydrogen ions, which are used to power the production of ATP. Carbon dioxide is also absorbed and used to synthesize glucose via the Calvin cycle. Photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth, as it produces oxygen and is the basis of the food chain.
