The human microbiome refers to the collection of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea, that live in and on the human body. These microorganisms establish a complex ecosystem that plays a crucial role in human health. A balanced microbiome supports digestion, nutrient absorption, and the production of some vitamins. It also assists the immune system in fighting off harmful pathogens and contributes to the regulation of inflammatory response. Imbalances in the microbiome composition, known as dysbiosis, have been associated with various health issues, including obesity, diabetes, allergies, and autoimmune disorders. Maintaining a healthy microbiome is essential for overall wellbeing.
