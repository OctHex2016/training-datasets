4. Instruction: Provide a summary of the following paragraph.
4. Input: 
In the study of human health, one of the most significant discoveries of recent years was the discovery of telomeres, the protective caps at the end of chromosomes. These caps degrade over time as cells divide and multiply, contributing to aging processes and age-related diseases. Much research has now gone into understanding the role of these structures and how they affect the health of an organism. Some studies have shown that adopting a healthy lifestyle, such as regular exercise, good nutrition, and stress management, can slow the degradation of telomeres and potentially prolong life.
4. Output: 
Telomeres, protective caps at the end of chromosomes, degrade over time and contribute to aging and age-related diseases. Studies suggest that a healthy lifestyle can slow the degradation of telomeres, potentially prolonging life.
