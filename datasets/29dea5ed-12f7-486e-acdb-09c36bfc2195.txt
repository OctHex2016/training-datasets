4. Instruction: Explain the process of photosynthesis in simple terms.
4. Input: 
<noinput>
4. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into food. Sunlight provides the energy needed to power the process, while carbon dioxide and water act as raw materials. During photosynthesis, the plants absorb sunlight, take in carbon dioxide from the air, and use water absorbed by their roots. The plants then produce glucose, a type of sugar that provides energy and acts as a building block for growth, along with oxygen as a byproduct, which is released into the atmosphere.
