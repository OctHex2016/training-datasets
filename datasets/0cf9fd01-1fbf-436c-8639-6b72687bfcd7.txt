The Brainâ€“Computer Interface (BCI) is an emerging technology that allows direct communication between the human brain and machines. It has the potential to dramatically alter the way people interact with their electronic devices, as well as benefit those with physical disabilities. BCIs have been primarily studied for their possible applications in stroke rehabilitation and control of prostheses, and the technology has shown promise in cases where individuals have lost control over their limbs due to neurological disorders or amputations. With further research and development, BCIs could become a common, mainstream technology, improving the quality of life for people with physical disabilities and changing the way we interact with technology.
