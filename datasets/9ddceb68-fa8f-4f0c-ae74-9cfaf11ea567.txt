12. Instruction: Explain the greenhouse effect in simple terms.

12. Input:
<noinput>

12. Output:
The greenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs when certain gases in Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat from the sun. These gases, called greenhouse gases, absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, preventing it from escaping into space. This trapped heat warms the Earth's surface, making our planet habitable. However, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have increased greenhouse gas levels, which intensifies the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change.
