10. Input: <noinput>
10. Output: 
An electric generator works by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. It uses the principle of electromagnetic induction, where a magnetic field interacts with a conductor, such as a coil of wire, to create an electric current. When the coil rotates in the magnetic field or a magnetic field moves around a stationary coil, a current is induced in the wire. This generated electricity can then be used to power various devices and appliances.

11. Instruction: Explain the greenhouse effect.
11. Input: <noinput>
11. Output: 
The greenhouse effect is a natural process by which certain gases in Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat from the sun. These gases allow sunlight to pass through to the Earth's surface but absorb and re-radiate the infrared heat or longwave radiation emitted by the Earth. By trapping heat in the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect helps keep the Earth's temperature stable and suitable for life. However, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have increased greenhouse gas concentrations, leading to enhanced greenhouse effects and global warming.
