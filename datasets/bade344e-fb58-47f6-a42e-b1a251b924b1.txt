To her surprise, the letter revealed a map detailing a secret passageway beneath the house. Intrigued, Sarah confirmed with the landlord there was a cellar. Confronted with an air of skepticism, Sarah ventured into the cellar. As she descended, she discovered a labyrinth of tunnels that seemed to lead in every direction. Armed with courage and the map, Sarah began her journey. The tunnels led her to extraordinary places she never fathomed, and one hidden room contained the answer to her ancestry.
