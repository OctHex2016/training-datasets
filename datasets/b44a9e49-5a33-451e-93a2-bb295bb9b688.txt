15. Instruction: Explain the process of photosynthesis. 
15. Input: 
<noinput>
15. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This process involves capturing light energy through pigment molecules called chlorophyll, which are found in the plant's leaves. The light energy is then used to power a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and energy-rich carbohydrates. This process is essential for the survival of plants and other photosynthetic organisms, and is also an important source of oxygen for the planet.
