4. Instruction: Explain the process of photosynthesis.
4. Input: 
<noinput>
4. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into chemical energy, which is stored in organic molecules like glucose. The process occurs primarily in the chlorophyll-containing cells called chloroplasts. Photosynthesis consists of two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll, and the energy is used to create ATP and NADPH. During the Calvin cycle, CO2 is converted into glucose using the energy stored in ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions. Oxygen is produced as a byproduct.
