4. Instruction: Summarize the key points of the provided text.
4. Input: 
Climate change is rapidly altering the Earth's environment, with severe consequences for both people and the planet. The melting of the polar ice caps is causing sea levels to rise, which in turn is leading to increased flooding in coastal areas. This has become a particularly significant issue for many island nations that are at risk of being submerged as a result of higher water levels. Additionally, extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and droughts, are becoming more frequent and more intense, putting countless lives and livelihoods at risk. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development are essential in order to mitigate these impacts and protect the Earth's ecosystems for future generations.
4. Output: 
The key points of the text are that climate change is causing significant environmental impacts, such as rising sea levels and frequent extreme weather events. Coastal areas and island nations face serious risks from flooding, and lives and livelihoods are threatened by hurricanes and droughts. Reducing greenhouse gases and promoting sustainable development are critical to mitigate the consequences and protect Earth's ecosystems.
