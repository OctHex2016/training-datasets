4. Instruction: Summarize the essential message of the following passage.
4. Input: 
Coral reefs are vital ecosystems in the ocean world. They harbor a quarter of all marine species, despite covering only 0.1% of the ocean floor. Reefs protect coastlines from storms, preventing coastal erosion and minimizing damage caused by surging waves. Additionally, they support tourism industries and local fisheries, directly benefiting the economies of many coastal nations. Unfortunately, climate change and other human activities have taken a toll on coral reefs, causing bleaching, diseases, and dying off at an alarming rate. If we do not act immediately to reduce these stressors, these vital ecosystems will be lost forever.
4. Output: 
Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that protect coastlines, support marine biodiversity, and contribute to the economy. However, due to human activities and climate change, they are suffering from bleaching, diseases, and death. Immediate action is needed to save these precious ecosystems.

<noinput>

Photosynthesis is a process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen.

The oxygen is released as a byproduct, while the hydrogen combines with carbon dioxide to form glucose, a source of energy and building block for the plant's growth.
