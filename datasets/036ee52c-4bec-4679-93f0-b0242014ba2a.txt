In the garden where friendships bloom,
Through laughter's light and sorrow's gloom,
A bond that grows in strength each day,
Soft whispers, warm hugs, here to stay.

The whispers of secrets, dreams unfold,
A treasure chest of memories, untold,
Roots run deep, inseparable, we've become,
In life's vast journey, friends united as one.

5. Instruction: Summarize the key points of the article in your own words.
5. Input: 
A new study published in the Journal of Science reveals that moderate exercise is more beneficial for mental health than extreme workouts. The researchers assessed 1.2 million adults from different age groups and backgrounds, who provided self-reported mental health data along with their exercise habits. The results show that individuals who engage in frequent but moderate exercise, such as brisk walking for 45-60 minutes, have 43% fewer days of poor mental health in a month compared to those who do not exercise. While it might be tempting to engage in more intense exercise, such as high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or heavy weightlifting, the study found that these do not offer the same mental health benefits. The researchers recommend finding a balance between physical and mental health in order to reap the most benefits.

Abraham Lincoln
11. Output: 
Abraham Lincoln, born on February 12, 1809, in Kentucky, was the 16th President of the United States (1861-1865). Raised in a humble log cabin, Lincoln was largely self-educated and worked various jobs before entering politics. In 1834, he was elected to the Illinois State Legislature and later served a term in the U.S. House of Representatives. He gained national prominence in 1858 during a series of iconic debates with Stephen Douglas. Lincoln won the presidential election in 1860, leading to southern states seceding from the Union and the start of the Civil War. Throughout his presidency, Lincoln skillfully navigated through political and military challenges, ultimately abolishing slavery through the Emancipation Proclamation and preserving the Union. Tragically, he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth in Ford's Theatre on April 14, 1865, just days after the Civil War ended.
