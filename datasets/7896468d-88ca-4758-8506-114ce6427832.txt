10. Instruction: Explain the basics of how an electric car works.
10. Input: 
<noinput>
10. Output: 
An electric car operates using an electric motor powered by rechargeable battery packs. Instead of a traditional internal combustion engine that burns fossil fuel, the electric motor converts electrical energy from the battery into mechanical energy, propelling the car. Electric cars are charged at charging stations or with home charging equipment by plugging them into an electrical outlet. Regenerative braking systems help to recharge the batteries during driving, converting kinetic energy produced while slowing down back into stored electrical energy.

11. Instruction: Provide a brief history of the invention of the telephone.
11. Input: 
<noinput>
11. Output: 
The telephone, a device allowing voice communication over long distances, was primarily invented by Alexander Graham Bell in the 1870s. Elisha Gray, Bell's competitor, simultaneously filed a patent caveat on the same day, leading to legal disputes. However, Bell received the patent, and in 1876, he conducted the first successful telephone transmission, stating "Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you." Over the next decades, telephone technology advanced, with rotary dial and touch-tone keypad systems emerging. Today, smartphones are the modern evolution of the telephone.

14. Instruction: Describe the process of photosynthesis in simple terms.
14. Input: 
<noinput>
14. Output: 
Photosynthesis is a process in which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into energy. They capture sunlight using chlorophyll, a pigment in their cells. This energy is then used to combine carbon dioxide (from the air) and water (from the roots). As a result, they create glucose, which provides nourishment to grow and reproduce, and release oxygen as a byproduct.

###
15. Instruction: Explain in simple terms how a refrigerator keeps food cool.
15. Input: 
<noinput>
15. Output: 
A refrigerator keeps food cool by using a closed-loop cooling system that circulates a substance called a refrigerant. The refrigerant moves through a compressor, which applies pressure, causing it to heat up and become a gas. The hot gas then flows through coils at the back of the refrigerator, releasing heat into the surrounding air. This causes the refrigerant to cool down and condense into a liquid. As it passes through an expansion valve, it evaporates and absorbs heat from inside the refrigerator, making it cooler. The cycle then repeats.
