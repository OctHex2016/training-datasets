Experiment: Randomly assign participants into two groups: Group A (the experimental group) and Group B (the control group). Both groups will have equal access to study materials and resources.

18. Input: 
Researchers conducted an online survey to study the impact of social media use on self-esteem in teenagers. They received 250 responses to the survey.

One potential limitation is the sample size and selection bias. With only 250 participants, the findings may not be generalizable to the larger population of teenagers. Additionally, the online survey might primarily attract those with more frequent social media use, skewing the data and limiting the representation of the general teenage population.

Furthermore, nuclear power remains one of the most reliable and carbon-free sources of energy available.
