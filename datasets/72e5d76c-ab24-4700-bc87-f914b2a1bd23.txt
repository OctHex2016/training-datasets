5. Instruction: Summarize the article given below.
5. Input: 
Scientists have recently discovered that plants provide a network of natural noise-cancellation in cities. In a study published in the journal PNAS, researchers found that strategically planting trees and bushes in urban areas can reduce noise pollution by up to 10 decibels. The researchers used computer models to simulate the flow of sound waves through different plant arrangements and concluded that dense vegetation with overlapping leaves is the most effective at blocking out noise. Furthermore, employing different plant species with various leaf shapes and sizes enhances the vegetation's noise-canceling capabilities. The study provides significant implications for urban planning and could help improve the quality of life in cities by reducing noise pollution.

Beneath the sun's warm golden face.

Nature's song, a gentle ease.

Majestic mountains, peaks so high,
Kissing clouds within the sky.
Nature's beauty, so profound,
A peaceful haven, we have found.
