10. Instruction: Explain what a black hole is and how it forms.
10. Input: <noinput>
10. Output: 
A black hole is a region of spacetime with an extremely powerful gravitational pull. It forms when a massive star's core collapses, and the immense gravity causes the formation of a point of infinite density, called a singularity. Due to the overwhelming gravity, the escape velocity within a certain boundary (the event horizon) exceeds the speed of light; therefore, nothing, even light, can escape the black hole's gravitational pull.
