Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The process has two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).

In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments absorb light energy in the form of photons. This energy is used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are high-energy molecules. Oxygen is produced as a byproduct when water molecules are split during these reactions.

The light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, take place in the stroma of the chloroplasts. During this stage, the energy stored in ATP and NADPH is used to fix carbon dioxide into an organic molecule through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The final product of this cycle is glucose, which can be further converted into other types of energy storage units like starch or cellulose or used for growth and maintenance in the plant.

Overall, photosynthesis is a crucial process for the survival of plants and serves as the base of the food chain for almost all life on Earth, as it's the primary source of oxygen and glucose.
