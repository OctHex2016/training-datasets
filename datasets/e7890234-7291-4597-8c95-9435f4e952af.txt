5. Instruction: Summarize the given paragraph focusing on the main point.
5. Input: 
The term artificial intelligence was first coined in 1956, but the idea of AI has been in existence for a few decades before that. While computers have become more advanced over time, true artificial intelligence involves much more than simple data processing. An AI system should also be able to think and learn, adapting its programming to new situations and dealing with problems that it was never explicitly designed to do. While human beings have yet to create a truly sentient artificial intelligence, many experts believe it is only a matter of time before such technology becomes reality.
5. Output: 
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a concept since the 1950s, but it involves more than just data processing, requiring systems to think, learn, and adapt to new situations. Creating truly sentient AI is an ongoing challenge but may become a reality in the future.
