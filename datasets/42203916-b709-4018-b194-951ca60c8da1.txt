14. Instruction: Explain how photosynthesis works in plants.
14. Input: <noinput>
14. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth. During photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight using chlorophyll, a pigment found in the chloroplasts of their cells. They also take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from their roots. Through a series of chemical reactions, the light energy is used to combine carbon dioxide and water, forming glucose, a type of sugar, and releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The glucose is then used by the plant for energy and growth, while the oxygen gets released into the atmosphere.

18. Instruction: Explain the concept of supply and demand in economics.
18. Input: <noinput>
18. Output: 
Supply and demand is a fundamental concept in economics that describes the relationship between the availability of a product (supply) and the desire of consumers for that product (demand). As the demand for a product increases, its price generally rises, which, in turn, incentivizes suppliers to produce more of the product to meet the increased demand. Conversely, when demand decreases or there is an oversupply, prices tend to drop as suppliers compete for consumers. This push and pull between supply and demand helps establish equilibrium in markets, balancing the needs of consumers with the ability of producers to supply goods.
