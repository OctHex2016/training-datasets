5. Instruction: Write a brief summary of the given article.
5. Input: 
Scientists from the University of San Francisco have discovered a new type of enzyme that appears to have promising potential in the treatment of cancer. The enzyme, called NPL6, has been found to be capable of targeting and destroying cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells unharmed. Researchers believe that this unique ability could lead to more effective, safer treatments for a wide variety of cancer types.

In a recent study, the scientists tested the enzyme on various cancer cells, including lung, breast, and colon cancer cells. The results demonstrated that NPL6 was effective at inhibiting the growth of these cancer cells. Additionally, NPL6 displayed minimal toxicity to healthy cells, making it a promising candidate for cancer treatment.

Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanism by which NPL6 targets cancer cells, and to develop effective, targeted drug therapies based on the enzyme. If the enzyme proves effective at targeting cancer cells in humans, it could revolutionize cancer treatment and potentially save millions of lives.
5. Output: 
Researchers at the University of San Francisco have discovered an enzyme, NPL6, that can target and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. Preliminary studies show NPL6 effectively inhibits the growth of various cancer cells, such as lung, breast, and colon cancer, with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Further research is required to understand NPL6's mechanism and to develop targeted drug therapies, potentially revolutionizing cancer treatment.

The logo for TechTrends features a gear icon in blue, which is surrounded by curved, green arrows pointing outward. The company name, "TechTrends," is written in black, italicized Arial font beneath the gear and arrows.
