Renewable energy resources are natural sources of power that can be replenished or are inexhaustible, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass energy. In contrast, non-renewable energy resources are finite resources that cannot be replenished, like fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and nuclear power (uranium). They eventually get depleted with continued use, contributing to environmental issues like pollution and climate change.

20. Instruction: Explain the basics of how a car engine works.
20. Input:
<noinput>
20. Output:
A car engine, typically an internal combustion engine, converts chemical energy from fuel into mechanical energy to propel the vehicle. It consists of connected cylinders where a process of four stages (intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust) occurs in a continuous cycle. During intake, the engine pulls in a mixture of air and fuel. Next, the piston compresses the mixture in the compression stage. Combustion occurs when the compressed mixture is ignited by the spark plug, causing expansion and forcing the piston to move, generating mechanical energy. Finally, in the exhaust stage, the piston expels the spent gases. This cycle repeats, with the engine's connecting rods and crankshaft converting linear piston movement into rotational motion to power the car's wheels.
