5. Instruction: Summarize the key points of the given article.
5. Input: 
Researchers at the University of California have developed a new type of nanofiber-based material that can remove toxic heavy metals, such as lead and arsenic, from water. The material was tested in lab-scale experiments, and it successfully removed over 99.9% of the contaminants. This could provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for improving drinking water quality in developing nations and a potential solution for cleaning up polluted environments. The study was recently published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, and the researchers hope to launch field tests soon to determine its effectiveness in real-world conditions.
