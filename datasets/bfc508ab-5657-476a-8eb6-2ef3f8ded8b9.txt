4. Input:
<noinput>
4. Output:
Upon the peak, a throne of stone,
A mountain stands, aloof, alone,
Against the winds, against the rain,
A silent king, with endless reign.

Majestic, with its head held high,
Its soaring pillars touch the sky,
A canvas for the sun's descent,
Awe-inspiring, circumference bent.

The mountain, regal in its stance,
With every summit's grace, enchants,
And in its presence, we shall find,
The humbling force of nature's grind.
