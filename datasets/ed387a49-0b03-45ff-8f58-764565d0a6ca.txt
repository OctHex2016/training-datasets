8. Instruction: Explain the process of photosynthesis.
8. Input: <noinput>
8. Output: 
Photosynthesis is a process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, mainly from the sun, into chemical energy. It involves the absorption of carbon dioxide and water through the leaves or other parts of the organism. In the presence of sunlight, these reactants undergo a series of chemical reactions in the chlorophyll-containing cells called chloroplasts. These reactions produce glucose, a type of sugar that serves as the energy source for the plant, and release oxygen as a byproduct. The overall process can be summarized by the following equation:

6CO2 (carbon dioxide) + 6H2O (water) + light energy -> C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 (oxygen)
