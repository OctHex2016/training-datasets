20. Input: <noinput>
20. Output: 
Photosynthesis is a biological process in which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O) into energy in the form of glucose (sugar) and oxygen. It primarily takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and used to drive a series of chemical reactions. These reactions result in the production of glucose, which is used by the organism for growth, reproduction, and energy, while oxygen is released as a byproduct.
