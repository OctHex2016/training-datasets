20. Instruction: Explain what the Doppler Effect is.
20. Input:
<noinput>
20. Output:
The Doppler Effect is a phenomenon that occurs when there is a relative change in the frequency of a wave due to the motion of the observer, the source of the wave, or both. It is most commonly illustrated by the change in pitch of a siren or horn when it passes by an observer. As the sound source approaches the observer, the perceived pitch increases; as the source moves away, the perceived pitch decreases. This effect also applies to light waves in the form of the redshift and blueshift observed in celestial objects.
