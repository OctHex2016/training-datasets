Natural selection is a process where species evolve over time due to natural environmental factors. The best-adapted organisms to their environment survive, reproduce, and pass on their genes to the next generation, whereas less-adapted organisms may not survive or reproduce. Examples include colorations providing camouflage, efficient foraging strategies, or adaptations to specific conditions like temperature or altitude.

Artificial selection is the process by which humans selectively breed plants and animals to produce specific traits. People intentionally choose which individuals get to reproduce based on desirable characteristics, which may not necessarily provide survival advantage in the wild. Examples include creating dog breeds with certain physical characteristics or breeding plants to have higher crop yields or resistance to pests.
