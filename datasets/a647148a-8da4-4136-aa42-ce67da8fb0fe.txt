16. Instruction: Explain how an electric motor works in simple terms.
16. Input:
<noinput>
16. Output:
An electric motor works by using electricity to create a magnetic field that interacts with the motor's magnets to generate a rotational force, causing the motor to spin. This is achieved by passing an electric current through a wire coil (called the "armature") placed between two permanent magnets, creating a temporary electromagnet. The resulting interaction of the magnetic fields causes the armature to rotate, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, which can then be used to power various devices and machines.
