6. Instruction: Summarize the following article in one paragraph.
6. Input: 
A recent study by California's Public Utilities Commission has revealed a surprise windfall of approximately 3.2 million acre-feet of water - enough to serve nearly six million families for a year. The extra water, discovered during a statewide audit of the water infrastructure system, was due to extensive repairing works done to fix the meters associated with water regulation infrastructure. The news has been warmly greeted by the public, who have been dealing with severe droughts and high water prices for the past several years. The Commission is hopeful that this fresh infusion of water into California's reservoir systems could alleviate drought pressures and help control water costs. Despite these benefits, some critics argue that the findings are only a temporary fix to the state's growing water crisis.
