20. Instruction: Explain the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis.
20. Input:
<noinput>
20. Output:
Chlorophyll plays a critical role in the process of photosynthesis, which plants use to convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This green pigment is present in the chloroplasts of plant cells, capturing light energy from the sun. When chlorophyll absorbs light, it triggers chemical reactions that ultimately lead to the production of glucose and oxygen. In short, chlorophyll functions as the light-absorbing agent that enables plants to produce the energy they need to grow and survive.
