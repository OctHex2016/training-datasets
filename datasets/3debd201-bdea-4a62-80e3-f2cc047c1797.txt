20. Input: 
<noinput>
20. Output: 
Supply and demand refers to the relationship between the availability of a product or service and the demand for it. If the supply of a product is limited, and there is high demand, the price will increase. Conversely, if the supply is high and there is low demand, the price will decrease. In short, the more that people want something, the higher the price will be, and the less they want something, the lower the price will be. This concept is fundamental to economics, as it affects the price of virtually everything in the marketplace.
