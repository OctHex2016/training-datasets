8. Instruction: Advise on how to take care of a houseplant.
8. Input:
Plant type: Aloe Vera
8. Output:
To take care of your Aloe Vera houseplant, follow these steps:

1. Lighting: Place your plant in a bright and sunny spot, ideally near a south or west-facing window. Aloe Vera prefers indirect sunlight.
2. Watering: Ensure the soil is well-draining. Water the plant thoroughly, waiting until the soil feels dry to the touch before watering again. Remember: over-watering is the most common issue with Aloe Vera plants.
3. Soil: Use a well-draining, sandy or succulent potting mix to prevent root rot.
4. Temperature: Keep your Aloe Vera in a room with a temperature between 55-80°F (13-27°C). Avoid placing it near drafts or heating vents.
5. Repotting: Only repot when the plant has outgrown its container or the potting mix has broken down. Use a pot with drainage holes and follow the same soil requirements.

9. Instruction: Summarize the article in a short paragraph.
9. Input:
NASA’s Perseverance rover has achieved another Martian milestone, capturing the first-ever video of its own parachute deploying during its descent through the planet's atmosphere. In a blog post, the agency published the stunning video, showcasing the deployment of the 70.5-foot wide parachute over a brief three-quarter second time period on February 18. According to NASA, the footage reveals that small changes made in the structure and suspension lines gave the parachute a cleaner, more even surface than previous designs, allowing it to catch more wind in the thin Martian atmosphere. John McNamee, Perseverance project manager, stated that this crucial moment demonstrates the parachute's robustness, enabling the rover's successful landing on Mars.
