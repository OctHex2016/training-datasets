13. Instruction: Provide a brief explanation of photosynthesis.
13. Input:
<noinput>
13. Output:
Photosynthesis is a chemical process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose or other sugars. During photosynthesis, the organisms take in carbon dioxide and water, and with the help of sunlight and chlorophyll, they produce oxygen and glucose. This process plays a critical role in supporting life on Earth, as it generates oxygen and serves as the basis for the food chain.

16. Instruction: Determine the main theme of the following poem.
16. Input:
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
- Robert Frost
