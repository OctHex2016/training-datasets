4. Input: <noinput>
4. Output:
The leaves fall softly to the ground,
Their colors crisp and bright.
The chill of autumn in the air,
A harbinger of night.

Winter snows come on the wind,
Their whiteness pure and true.
Cold and frost they bring to earth,
A wonderland anew.

The melting snows of spring arrive,
Their promise sweet and dear.
The warmth of sun and lengthening days,
Renewal of the year.

Summer's heat and vibrant blooms,
Their colors bright and bold.
But life is fleeting all too soon,
As autumn comes once more to hold.
