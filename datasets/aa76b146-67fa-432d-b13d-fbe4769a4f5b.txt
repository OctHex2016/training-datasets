Can you help me understand how a computer that uses only 0s and 1s can perform such complex tasks?
11. Output: 
At the most basic level, a computer processes information in binary form, which consists of only 0s and 1s. These two values represent the electrical states of on and off, and they form the foundation of all computing systems. By combining these binary digits (or bits) in various patterns, a computer can encode more complex information, such as numbers, letters, and symbols. This encoding allows the computer to perform operations, execute algorithms, and ultimately accomplish complex tasks through a series of simple, binary-based steps.
