In a nutshell, American Football is a game played by two teams of 11 players each, striving to advance the ball down the field to score points. Points can be scored by carrying the ball into the opposing team's end zone, catching a pass in the end zone, or kicking the ball through the goal posts. The game consists of four 15-minute quarters and each team has four sets of plays they can use to advance the ball 10 yards. The defense tries to stop the offense from advancing and if they succeed, they regain possession of the ball. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.
