9. Instruction: Compare a novel with its movie adaptation.
9. Input:
"The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald and the 2013 film directed by Baz Luhrmann
9. Output:
The novel "The Great Gatsby" is a timeless classic written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, which delves into themes of wealth, love, and the disillusionment of the American Dream. The 2013 movie adaptation, directed by Baz Luhrmann, maintains the core of the story but adds a modern and visually spectacular twist to it. While the novel relies heavily on descriptive language and symbolism to convey its message, the movie emphasizes extravagant visuals, costume design, and mannerisms of the characters to bring the roaring 1920s to life. The movie may be more accessible for modern audiences, but it potentially sacrifices the depth and intricacy of Fitzgerald's original text.
