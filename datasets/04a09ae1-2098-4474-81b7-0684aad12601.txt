4. Instruction: Summarize the main ideas of the provided text.
4. Input: 
Despite the popularity of freelancing, remote working, and other flexible work arrangements, the concept of the 9-to-5 workday remains the dominant work schedule in most organizations. However, recent studies have questioned its effectiveness for modern employees who juggle multiple responsibilities, often operating within a "gig economy." Flexible work arrangements have been identified as a way to improve overall job satisfaction, work-life balance, and even productivity. For instance, giving employees the option to choose the hours they work may result in a reduction in tardiness and increase overall job satisfaction, as they can adjust their work schedule to better accommodate personal commitments, such as childcare or personal hobbies. Furthermore, when flexibility is incorporated into the work environment, it encourages employees to become more adaptable and open to change.

4. Output:
The 9-to-5 workday is still prevalent, but its effectiveness is being questioned due to the rise of freelancing, remote work, and flexible arrangements. Alternatives like flexible schedules can enhance job satisfaction, work-life balance, and productivity by allowing employees to adjust their work hours according to personal commitments. Implementing flexibility can also lead to more adaptable and open-minded employees.
