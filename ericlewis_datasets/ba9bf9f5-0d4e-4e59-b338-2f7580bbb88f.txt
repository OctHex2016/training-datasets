Scientists have developed a method to analyze proteins that is capable of detecting changes in the structure of a protein molecule, which affects its function. The researchers believe that this method could help to explain how diseases occur and potentially lead to new treatments in the future. The method, which is called ANCHOR, is based on using mass spectrometry to gradually expose the protein to increasing levels of heat, until the protein unfolds and its structure can be analyzed. The researchers hope that this method could be used to develop targeted treatment for protein-based diseases.
