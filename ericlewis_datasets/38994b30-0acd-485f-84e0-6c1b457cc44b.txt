6. Instruction: Explain how photosynthesis works.
6. Input: 
<noinput>
6. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. It occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll pigments within the chloroplasts absorb sunlight, generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen). These energy-rich molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions to fix carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose, which can be utilized by the organism as an energy source or building block for growth. Oxygen is released as a byproduct during this process.7. Instruction: Translate the following English text into French.

10. Instruction: Describe the process of evaporation.
10. Input: 
<noinput>
10. Output: 
Evaporation is the process by which a liquid substance, such as water, turns into a vapor or gas. It occurs when molecules at the surface of the liquid absorb sufficient energy from their surroundings to overcome their intermolecular forces and escape into the air. Evaporation is a cooling process because the most energetic molecules are the ones that tend to escape, leaving the remaining liquid with a lower average energy, thus cooler. Factors that increase the rate of evaporation include higher temperatures, lower humidity, increased surface area, and stronger air currents above the liquid's surface.11.
