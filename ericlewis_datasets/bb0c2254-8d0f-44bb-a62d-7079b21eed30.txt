The European Union, on the other hand, was founded in 1993 with the signing of the Maastricht Treaty. It was created as a political and economic union between European countries to promote peace, stability, and economic cooperation. The EU has evolved through several stages, starting as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and the European Economic Community in 1957.
