13. Instruction: Explain how photosynthesis works in plants.
13. Input: 
<noinput>
13. Output: 
Photosynthesis is a process in plants where they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. This occurs in the chloroplasts, organelles containing chlorophyll, which is responsible for capturing sunlight. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and used to power reactions that produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), both high-energy molecules. These molecules, along with carbon dioxide, are used in the Calvin Cycle, a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that produce glucose. Oxygen is released as a byproduct during this process.

Capitalism, on the other hand, emphasizes private ownership of resources and relies on the concept of the free market to determine the distribution of goods and services.
