Once upon a time in a small village, two friends, Tom and Jerry, decided to visit the city to start a new life. They had heard that people could turn their lives around in the city, and they were determined to find success. When they arrived, they were dazzled by the opportunities.

Tom, a hardworking young man, decided to focus on learning new skills and building strong relationships. Jerry, on the other hand, was always looking for shortcuts and easy ways to get rich. He involved himself in risky and illegal activities, hoping to strike it big. At first, Jerry seemed to be getting ahead, while Tom's progress appeared slow.

One day, Jerry's luck ran out. He was caught and imprisoned for his illegal activities, losing everything he had gained. Meanwhile, Tom's hard work and dedication began to pay off. He found a stable job, built a loving family, and earned the respect of his community.
