4. Output: 
Overview: A smartwatch is a wearable computing device designed to be worn on a user's wrist. It offers a combination of features such as fitness tracking, notifications from your smartphone, and the ability to run various apps. 

Key benefits:
1. Convenience: Access notifications, messages, and calls on your wrist without constantly checking your phone.
2. Health and fitness tracking: Monitor your heart rate, sleep patterns, and daily steps with built-in sensors.
3. GPS navigation: Receive turn-by-turn directions on your wrist for hands-free navigation.
4. Media control: Manage your music playback or adjust volume without reaching for your phone.
5. Customization: Change watch faces, apps, and bands to match your style or preference.

5. Instruction: Analyze the pros and cons of using solar energy for residential use.
5. Input:
<noinput>
5. Output:
Pros:
1. Renewable energy source: Solar energy is endlessly abundant and doesn't deplete natural resources.
2. Reduced electricity bills: Installing solar panels lowers the homeowner's reliance on the grid, leading to savings on electricity bills.
3. Low maintenance: Solar panels require minimal maintenance, as there are no moving parts, and most systems come with a long warranty.
4. Environmental benefits: Solar energy production does not create air or water pollution, helping to reduce carbon footprint.

Cons:
1. High initial cost: Purchasing and installing solar panels can be expensive, though costs have dropped significantly in recent years.
2. Intermittent energy production: Solar energy production is limited by weather conditions, and energy storage options can be expensive.
3. Space requirements: Rooftop or yard space is needed for solar panel installation, which may not be ideal for some homes.
4. Aesthetic impact: Some people may find solar panels visually unappealing, impacting the curb appeal of the property.

6. Instruction: Provide a simple explanation of Einstein's theory of relativity.
6. Input:
<noinput>
6. Output:
Einstein's theory of relativity consists of two parts: Special Relativity and General Relativity. Special Relativity, introduced in 1905, states that space and time are intertwined and relative to the observer's frame of reference. This theory claims that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion. General Relativity, published in 1915, expands on this by explaining gravity not as a force, but as a curvature in spacetime caused by the presence of mass. This means that massive objects, like planets or stars, cause nearby spacetime to bend, making other objects move along curved paths towards them.
