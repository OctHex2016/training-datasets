4. Instruction: Please provide a brief analysis of this poem.
4. Input: 
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
4. Output: 
This excerpt is from Dylan Thomas's famous poem "Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night." It deals with the theme of facing death with courage and defiance, rather than submitting to it passively. The poem uses metaphorical language ("burn and rave") to describe how the elderly should continue to 'rage' against the loss of their vitality when they are nearing the end of their lives. The repetition of "rage, rage" emphasizes the need for continuous determination in the face of death.
