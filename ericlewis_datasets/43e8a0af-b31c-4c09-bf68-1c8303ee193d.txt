4. Instruction: Read the following text and pretend you are the main character. Write a diary entry about the day's events from the main character's perspective.
4. Input: 
You are Sarah, a 35-year-old single mother of two young kids. You work full-time as a nurse and are studying part-time to become a nurse practitioner. Today, you started a new job and met your new coworkers. During lunch, you spilled coffee on your white uniform, and everyone laughed at you. After work, you had an exam in your pharmacology class. You managed to finish the exam, but you were not confident about your answers. When you got home, your kids were asleep, and your babysitter had left a note about the great time they had at the park.
4. Output: 
Dear Diary,
Today was a rollercoaster of emotions. I started my new job, and I'm grateful for this opportunity. Meeting my new coworkers was exciting, but I felt embarrassed when I spilled coffee on my uniform during lunch. It's frustrating when everyone laughs at you, but I'll try not to let it bother me. My exam in pharmacology tonight was tough, and I'm not sure how well I did. I hope I can juggle everything - work, study, and being there for my kids. Speaking of my kids, they had a great time at the park with the babysitter. It's bittersweet; I'm happy they enjoyed it, but I wish I could have been there with them. Tomorrow's a new day, and I'll keep giving my best.

- Change "actualiy" to "actually"
- Change "do" to "did"
- Improve the sentence structure for clarity, such as: "The rabbit, instead of being scared, walked even closer to me."
- Consider combining similar ideas and removing unnecessary words to enhance readability.
