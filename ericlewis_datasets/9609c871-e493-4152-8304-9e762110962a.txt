<noinput>
9. Output:
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules designed to solve a specific problem in a finite number of steps. It guarantees an optimal or exact solution. A heuristic, on the other hand, is a problem-solving technique employing an approximate or practical approach that does not guarantee an optimal solution but is generally more efficient and quicker than an algorithm. Heuristics often rely on experience, common sense, or shortcuts to produce a satisfactory outcome.
