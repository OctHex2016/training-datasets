5. Input: 
<noinput>
5. Output: 
The Overconfidence Bias refers to a tendency for individuals to overestimate their knowledge, skills, or abilities, leading them to make poor decisions based on an inaccurate assessment of their capabilities. In decision making, this bias can have several implications, such as:

1. Ill-informed decisions: Overconfident decision makers may not gather sufficient information or may dismiss important data, thereby making choices based on incomplete or incorrect information.
2. Resistance to feedback: Due to their unwarranted belief in their abilities, overconfident individuals may reject constructive criticism or feedback and fail to adapt their decisions accordingly.
3. Increased risk-taking: An inflated sense of competence can result in a greater willingness to take risks, potentially leading to negative consequences if the risks go beyond the decision maker's true capabilities.
4. Diminished collaboration: Overconfident individuals may disregard the opinions and expertise of others or dismiss team members' contributions, which can hinder collaboration, limiting the quality and effectiveness of decisions made by a group.
