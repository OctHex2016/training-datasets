Mitosis is a form of cell division that produces two identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the original cell.

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more particles are linked together, even across vast distances.

This connection happens instantly, regardless of the distance between the particles, which led Einstein to call it "spooky action at a distance."
