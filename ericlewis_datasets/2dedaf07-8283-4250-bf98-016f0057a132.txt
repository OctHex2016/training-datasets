Begin by finding a comfortable and quiet space. Sit or lie down, close your eyes, and start taking slow, deep breaths.

Inhale deeply through your nose, feeling your chest expand, and then exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your chest contract. Keep a steady and relaxed rhythm. Focus on the sensation of your breath as it flows in and out of your body.

As thoughts arise in your mind, simply acknowledge them and let them pass without judgment. Return your focus to your breath, immersing yourself in the present moment. Maintain an attitude of kindness and acceptance towards your thoughts and feelings.

Spend a few moments in this state of mindfulness, letting your body relax and your mind find peace. When you're ready to return to your day, take a final deep breath and open your eyes.
