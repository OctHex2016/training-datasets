5. Instruction: Summarize the main idea of the passage below.
5. Input: 
Middle child syndrome refers to the belief that middle children are often overlooked in a family due to their birth order. As the middle child is not the oldest nor the youngest, they may feel lost or uncertain about their role within the family unit. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and a lack of self-confidence. However, recent research has found that birth order does not necessarily determine a child's personality or development. Instead, it is the unique experiences and relationships each child has within the family that shape their character and abilities.

Middle child syndrome suggests middle children may feel overlooked and lack self-confidence due to their birth order, but recent research shows that it is their unique experiences and relationships within the family which influence their character and abilities.
