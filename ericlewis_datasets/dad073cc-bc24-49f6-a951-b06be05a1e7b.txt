4. Instruction: Summarize the given passage. 
4. Input: 
Climate change is an urgent threat affecting every corner of our planet. This complex issue impacts humans, wildlife, and ecosystems on a global scale, and is most often caused by an increase in heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of human activities. Populations who are disproportionately affected by climate change are often those who contribute the least to the problem, causing social injustice and inequality. The effects of climate change include rising temperatures, extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, fires, and melting polar ice caps, all of which result in habitat loss, extinction, lowered agricultural productivity, and human displacement. By implementing renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions, and promoting sustainable practices, we can mitigate the consequences of climate change.
4. Output:
