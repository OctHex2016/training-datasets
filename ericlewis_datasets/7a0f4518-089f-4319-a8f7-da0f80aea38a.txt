Headline: "New Study Shows Drinking Coffee Reduces Risk of Heart Attacks"
Full article (150 words): A new study published in the American Journal of Cardiology shows a potential link between drinking coffee and a lower risk of heart attacks. The researchers found that those who drank at least three cups of coffee a day had a 21% lower risk of experiencing a heart attack compared to those who drank one or fewer cups per day. The study analyzed data from over 8,000 participants over a 15-year period and accounted for other factors such as smoking and diet. The researchers believe that natural compounds in coffee such as polyphenols and caffeine contribute to the lower risk.
