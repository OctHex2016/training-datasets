4. Instruction: Explain the difference between recombinant DNA and genomic DNA.
4. Input:
<noinput>
4. Output: 
Recombinant DNA refers to a DNA molecule formed by the joining of DNA fragments from different sources, typically through the use of genetic engineering techniques. This could involve inserting a gene from one organism into the DNA of another organism, often allowing the recipient organism to express the trait encoded by the inserted gene. Genomic DNA, on the other hand, is the native DNA found in an organism's cell, containing all the genetic information necessary for its growth, development, and reproduction. Genomic DNA includes both the protein-coding genes and non-coding regions of an organism's genome.
