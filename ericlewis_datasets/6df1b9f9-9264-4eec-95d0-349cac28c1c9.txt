9. Instruction: Explain the main differences between mitosis and meiosis.
9. Input: <noinput>
9. Output: 
Mitosis is the process of cell division that produces two genetically identical daughter cells, whereas meiosis results in four genetically unique daughter cells. Mitosis occurs in somatic (body) cells, while meiosis takes place in germ cells to produce gametes (sperm and egg cells). Mitosis consists of one division cycle, while meiosis consists of two division cycles (meiosis I and meiosis II). Additionally, the genetic diversity is increased during meiosis through the process of crossing over, which does not occur in mitosis.

17. Output: 
To make a simple paper airplane, start with a letter-sized or A4 sheet of paper. Fold the paper in half lengthwise and then unfold it, leaving a crease down the middle. Next, fold both top corners down to the center crease to form a triangle. Fold the newly created triangular flaps down along the center crease to make the top section of your plane. Then, fold the paper in half, tucking the triangle section in. Fold each side down to create wings, and you now have a simple paper airplane.

18. Instruction: Compare the process of photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
18. Input: <noinput>
18. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy through converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. It occurs in chloroplasts and is an anabolic (building) process. Cellular respiration, on the other hand, is the process by which all living organisms, including plants, break down glucose and release energy in the form of ATP. It occurs in the mitochondria and is a catabolic (breaking down) process. In summary, photosynthesis uses light energy to create glucose and oxygen, while cellular respiration breaks down glucose to produce energy in the form of ATP.
