4. Instruction: Summarize the main idea of an article.
4. Input: 
At its annual conference, the International Society of Sleep Medicine (ISSM) presented a new study that suggests an interesting relationship between artificial illumination and health. The research indicates that exposure to blue light emitted by electronic screens—such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops—at night has a direct impact on human sleep quality.

Over 500 participants filled out questionnaires about their exposure to electronic devices and their sleeping habits. Sleep quality was then assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which measures several factors, including sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and daytime dysfunction.

A deep association between exposure to artificial blue-rich light at night and the prevalence of sleep disturbances was revealed. Based on these observations, the ISSM declared that limiting exposure to artificial blue light at night could lead to improved sleep and overall health.

4. Output: 
A study presented by the International Society of Sleep Medicine indicates an association between nighttime exposure to artificial blue light from electronic screens and sleep quality. Limiting exposure to blue light at night may lead to better sleep and overall health.
