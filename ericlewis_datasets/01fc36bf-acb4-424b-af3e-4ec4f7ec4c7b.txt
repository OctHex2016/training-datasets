<noinput>
10. Output: 
Fiat money is a currency that has no intrinsic value and is backed by the trust and confidence of the people using it. This type of money is declared by a government to be legal tender and is usually not backed by a physical commodity. Commodity money, on the other hand, is money that has intrinsic value, as it is made from or backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver. The value of commodity money is based on the value of the underlying commodity, making it more stable and less prone to inflation compared to fiat money.
