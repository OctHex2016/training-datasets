4. Output: 
In the woods, a world of hush,
The forest whispers, calm and lush.
Leaves of green and branches sway,
A symphony, the wind doth play.

Sunlight trickles through the trees,
A gentle dance to put at ease.
Birdsong mingles with the breeze,
Serenade of forest peace.

Cares and worries fade away,
Nature's balm holds sway today.
In the woods, our spirits mend,
A haven for the heart, my friend.
