5. Instruction: Explain how hydroelectric power is generated.
5. Input: 
<noinput>
5. Output: 
Hydroelectric power is generated by harnessing the energy produced by moving water. This process typically involves constructing a dam across a river, creating a reservoir of water behind it. When the water is released, its gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as it flows downhill. This moving water is then channeled through turbines, causing them to rotate. The rotation of the turbines drives an electric generator, converting the mechanical energy into electricity, which can then be distributed through a power grid.
