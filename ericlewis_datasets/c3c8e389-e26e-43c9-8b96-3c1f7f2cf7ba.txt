8. Instruction: Analyze the following paragraph, extract the main argument, and provide a counterargument.
8. Input: 
While many people argue that the use of any recreational drug should be outright forbidden, I believe that responsible adults should have the right to choose whether or not to use marijuana. After all, alcohol is legal and yet can cause considerable damage when abused. Marijuana, on the other hand, has been proven to have significantly fewer adverse health effects than alcohol. Furthermore, legalizing marijuana would lead to a decrease in illegal drug trade, improving public safety.
8. Output: 
Main Argument: Responsible adults should have the right to choose whether or not to use marijuana since it has fewer adverse health effects than alcohol and its legalization would decrease the illegal drug trade.
Counterargument: While marijuana may have fewer adverse health effects than alcohol, drug legalization could potentially lead to an increase in substance abuse among vulnerable individuals, posing risks to public health and safety. Additionally, legalizing marijuana could be seen as condoning the use of other, more dangerous substances.
