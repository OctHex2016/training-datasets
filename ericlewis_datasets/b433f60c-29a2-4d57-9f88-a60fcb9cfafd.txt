10. Input:
<noinput>
10. Output: 
False. If you add an even integer and an odd integer, their sum will always be an odd number. This is because an even integer is divisible by 2 without a remainder, while an odd integer has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Adding the two together gives a remainder of 1, making the sum odd.
