8. Input: 
<noinput>
8. Output: 
Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy (glucose) using carbon dioxide and water as raw materials. During this process, oxygen is released as a byproduct. It occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, pigments like chlorophyll absorb light energy, which is then used to produce ATP and NADPH. In the light-independent reactions, CO2 is converted into glucose using the energy from ATP and NADPH.
