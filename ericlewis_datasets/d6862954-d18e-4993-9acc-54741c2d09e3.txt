4. Instruction: Summarize the following argument in a few sentences.
4. Input: 
In discussions of environmental conservation, one controversial issue has been whether or not governments should support a shift towards sustainable sources of energy. On the one hand, environmentalists argue that leveraging sustainable energy sources is vitally important for preserving the environment and combating climate change. They point out that many renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind farms, already supply power to the grid without contributing to air pollution, and that the number of these projects continues to grow each year. Furthermore, proponents of sustainable energy argue that advancements in technology will continue to make renewable resources more efficient and cost-effective, eventually reducing the need for subsidies. On the other hand, skeptics contend that renewable energy alone will not be sufficient to power the world's growing population and that there will always be a place for non-renewable energy sources, such as coal and nuclear power. They believe too much emphasis on renewable energy could stifle the development of cheaper alternatives and leave us vulnerable to energy crises.
4. Output: 
The argument addresses whether governments should support a shift towards sustainable energy. Environmentalists argue that renewable energy sources are essential for environmental conservation and combating climate change, while skeptics contend that renewable energy alone cannot meet the growing population's needs and insistence on renewables could hinder the development of cheaper alternatives.
