Scientists Discover New Earth-Like Planet

<article>
A team of astronomers led by Nasa scientists have made a remarkable discovery: a planet similar in size to Earth, orbiting a nearby star. The new planet, named Kepler-452b, is about 1,400 light-years away from our solar system and is said to be in the "habitable zone." This new planet is thought to have conditions appropriate for life.

The host star Kepler-452 is a close match to our sun, and Kepler-452b orbits it at a similar distance as the Earth. This suggests that the planet may have a similar climate to ours, with water and even liquid oceans. However, scientists say it's still too early to know for sure if there is life on the planet, with much more research required.
