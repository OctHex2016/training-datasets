4. Instruction: Explain the concept of photosynthesis.
4. Input: 
<noinput>
4. Output: 
Photosynthesis is a vital process carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, which allows them to convert sunlight into chemical energy.

The glucose provides the organisms with energy for growth and development, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere, contributing to the air we breathe. In essence, photosynthesis enables these organisms to produce their own food and plays a critical role in the Earth's oxygen and carbon cycles.

11. Input: 
Silent whispers roam,
Moonlight dances on the sea,
 Secrets lost in waves.11. Output: 
The poem presents a serene and mysterious atmosphere through its tone, imagery, and technique. The tone is calm and contemplative, evoking a sense of wonder and introspection. The imagery is rich in evoking a vivid mental picture: the gentle whispers, the moonlit sea, and secrets concealed within waves. In terms of technique, the poem employs a traditional haiku structure, utilizing 5-7-5 syllables to capture a brief yet poignant scene.
