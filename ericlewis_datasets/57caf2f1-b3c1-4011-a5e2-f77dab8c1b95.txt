4. Instruction: Provide a brief summary of the following article.
4. Input: 
Millions of people around the world experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) every year, with symptoms usually beginning in the fall and lasting through the winter. The transition from a season with increasing natural light exposure to one with decreased natural light may have a significant impact on our mood, energy levels, and sleep patterns.

Although the exact cause of SAD is not completely understood, it is believed that the reduced exposure to natural light during the fall and winter months can disrupt our body's internal clock. This can lead to depressive symptoms, along with fatigue, weight gain, and an increased need for sleep.

A common treatment for SAD is light therapy, which involves exposure to bright, artificial light for a specific period each day. This artificial light is designed to mimic the natural sunlight that is lacking during the darker months. Another treatment option is cognitive behavioral therapy, which can help sufferers to deal with negative thoughts and behaviors that may be contributing to their depressive mood. Additionally, antidepressant medications may also be prescribed to help manage the symptoms of SAD.

Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) affects millions of people worldwide, causing depressive symptoms, fatigue, weight gain, and increased sleep needs during fall and winter. Its cause is not fully understood, but reduced exposure to natural light and a disrupted internal clock seem to play a role. Common treatments include light therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and antidepressant medications.

5. Instruction: Describe how a bicycle works, from pedaling to the rotation of the wheels.
5. Input: 
<noinput>
5. Output: 
When a person pedals a bicycle, the force is transferred from the pedals to the chainwheel through the crank arms. The chainwheel has teeth, which mesh with the bicycle chain. As the chainwheel rotates due to pedaling, it pulls the chain forward. The chain, in turn, is connected to the rear cassette or freewheel, which is mounted on the rear wheel's hub. The cassette also has teeth that mesh with the chain, so as the chain is pulled, it rotates the cassette. This rotation is then transferred to the rear wheel, causing it to spin and propel the bicycle forward.

6. Instruction: Compare and contrast two types of alternative energy sources.
6. Input: 
Solar Energy and Wind Energy
6. Output: 
Solar energy captures sunlight to produce electricity, often through the use of solar panels. It relies on the availability of sunlight and, as a result, is dependent on weather conditions and time of day. Solar energy generation is relatively silent, has minimal moving parts, and produces no pollutant emissions during operation.

Wind energy, on the other hand, uses wind turbines to capture the kinetic energy in wind and convert it into electricity. Wind energy's efficiency depends on wind speed and geographical location, making it also reliant on weather conditions. Wind turbines have moving parts, can produce noise, and may pose a threat to bird populations if not built with proper considerations. However, like solar energy, wind energy is a clean and renewable source of power.
