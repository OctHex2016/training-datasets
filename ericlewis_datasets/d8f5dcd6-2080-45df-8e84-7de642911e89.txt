4. Instruction: Summarize the main idea of the given paragraph in a single sentence.
4. Input: 
Ocean acidification is the chemical process where the ocean becomes more acidic due to the excessive amount of carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities release carbon dioxide, which, when dissolved in the ocean, forms carbonic acid. This process changes the ocean's pH, affecting the marine life and ecosystems, particularly the calcifying species like corals, mollusks, and other shelled organisms.
