<noinput>
4. Output: 
To solve a Rubik's Cube, follow these steps:
1. Solve the white cross: Match white edge pieces with the centers of their corresponding colors to form a cross.
2. Complete the white corners: Place the white corner pieces in their correct positions by rotating them around their neighboring pieces.
3. Solve the middle layer: Insert edge pieces into the middle layer by matching their colors with the centers and using specific algorithms.
4. Create a yellow cross on the last layer: Use an algorithm to flip yellow edge pieces until you form a cross.
5. Solve the yellow face: Rotate the corner pieces so that the entire yellow face is solved.
6. Position last-layer corners: Use an algorithm to swap corner pieces until they match their neighboring centers.
7. Position last-layer edges: Use an algorithm to swap edge pieces until the Rubik's cube is solved.

It's helpful to learn specific algorithms and practice them repeatedly, as solving the cube relies on muscle memory.
