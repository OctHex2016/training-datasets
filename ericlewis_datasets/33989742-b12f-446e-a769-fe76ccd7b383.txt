They talked about owning their own land, a piece of paradise where they could live off the "fat of the land." This dream motivated them, pushing them forward in search of work wherever they went.

Often, in the lonely hours on the road, they marveled at their luck. They knew that most people who sought work in the dying economy were alone, while they had each other.
