4. Instruction: Briefly summarize the content of the given text.
4. Input:
Located in the Indian Ocean, the Maldives is a South Asian archipelago comprising 26 atolls and over 1,000 islands. Its stunning white-sand beaches and unique underwater beauty have made it a popular destination for honeymooners and divers. Primarily a tourism-driven economy, the Maldives is economically vulnerable due to its dependence on the sector, as well as the massive cost of importing goods. The Maldives is also geographically vulnerable. With a mean elevation of only 1.5 meters above sea level, environmental concerns such as sea-level rise and coastal erosion pose a significant threat to its existence.
4. Output:
The Maldives, a South Asian archipelago, is known for its picturesque beaches and underwater beauty. Its economy is heavily reliant on tourism, which contributes to its vulnerability. The country faces threats from issues like sea-level rise and coastal erosion due to its low elevation.

7. Instruction: What are the causes of climate change? Please briefly explain.
7. Input:
<noinput>
7. Output:
Climate change is mainly caused by human activities and natural factors. Human activities increase greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, through burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming. Natural factors, including volcanic eruptions, solar radiation, and changes in Earth's orbit, also contribute, although human-induced factors have had a more significant impact in recent times.
