4. Instruction: Summarize the following passage.

4. Input: 
Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to make unprecedented strides in various industries, from healthcare to finance to entertainment. Today, many AI advancements stem from the field of deep learning. By mimicking the structure and function of the human brain, deep learning algorithms have enabled the creation of artificial neural networks. These networks process vast amounts of data, which helps AI learn autonomously and improve performance, but they also require vast computational resources. Some of the most promising deep learning applications include natural language processing, machine translation, and image recognition. However, the field still faces challenges, such as the need for large volumes of training data, energy consumption, and improving the interpretability of AI models.

4. Output: 
Deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has made impressive progress in various areas, such as natural language processing and image recognition. However, the field still faces challenges related to data requirements, energy consumption, and AI model interpretability.
