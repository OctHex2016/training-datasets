###
6. Instruction: Identify three logical fallacies present in the given argument, and briefly explain each.
6. Input: 
UFOs are real because the government refuses to release all of their classified files on the subject, which clearly means they must be hiding something big. Besides, everyone knows that people who study UFOs are big sci-fi nerds, so they know more about it than anyone else. Moreover, I met a person who claims to have seen a UFO, and if one person saw it, there must be more credible witnesses out there.
6. Output:
1. Argument from ignorance: The claim that UFOs must be real because the government doesn't release their classified files assumes the subject is true due to a lack of contrary evidence.
2. Ad hominem: Discrediting skeptics by associating UFO researchers with "sci-fi nerds" undermines their arguments without addressing their actual points.
3. Anecdotal evidence: Using a single personal story to support a claim discounts the possibility of other explanations and presents the evidence as representative of a larger population.

And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
