These greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit the sun's energy as infrared radiation, causing the planet's surface temperature to rise. While the greenhouse effect is vital for sustaining life on Earth by maintaining a stable climate, human activities like burning fossil fuels have led to an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and subsequently, global warming.

18. Input:
<noinput>
18. Output:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and certain microorganisms convert sunlight into chemical energy, fueling their growth and nourishment. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules present within chloroplasts. This energy drives a reaction that merges carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with water absorbed by the plant's roots, resulting in the production of glucose (a simple sugar) and oxygen as a byproduct. Intended mainly for the organism's energy needs, glucose can also be stored or converted into more complex carbohydrates.
