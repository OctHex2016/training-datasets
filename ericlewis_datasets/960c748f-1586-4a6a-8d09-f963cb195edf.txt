4. Instruction: Summarize the given text into a few sentences.
4. Input: 
Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define a region's local or global climate. These changes can encompass various facets, from shifts in temperature, rainfall, or precipitation patterns to more frequent extreme events such as floods, droughts, storms, and heatwaves. The causes of climate change are complex, but the main driver behind the current rapid global warming is human activities, which have significantly increased greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. This, in turn, has raised the average global temperature, causing ice caps to melt, sea levels to rise, and an overall disruption of the Earth's ecosystems.

Since the industrial revolution, human activities like fossil fuel burning, deforestation, and industrial processes have released vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, resulting in a greenhouse effect, making the Earth's temperature rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified this human-induced greenhouse gas increase as the primary driver of recent global warming.

The consequences of climate change are severe and far-reaching. Impacts include loss of biodiversity, ocean acidification, changing weather patterns, a reduction in agricultural productivity, and the spread of diseases. In addition, climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations in developing countries, resulting in increased poverty, food insecurity, and migration. To address these challenges, international efforts are underway to curb greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to the changing climate, and foster sustainable development.
4. Output: 
Climate change involves long-term shifts in weather patterns, driven primarily by human activities that increase greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting global warming causes detrimental effects, including loss of biodiversity, ocean acidification, and negative impacts on agriculture and human health. Climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in developing countries, emphasizing the need for international efforts to reduce emissions, adapt to the changing climate, and support sustainable development.
