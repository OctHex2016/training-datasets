10. Input: 
<noinput>
10. Output: 
Use the spaced repetition technique. This involves reviewing new vocabulary items regularly with decreasing frequency as they become more familiar. Start by reviewing new words daily, then gradually extend the review intervals to every few days, then every week, and eventually monthly. This helps consolidate the new vocabulary into long-term memory by leveraging the forgetting curve. Combine this with mnemonic techniques for better memorization.
