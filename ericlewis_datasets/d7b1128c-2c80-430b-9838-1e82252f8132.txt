Roses are flowing down the stream
While whispers travel in the wind
Tears descend as the sun reclines
Joy departs as the moon awakes

The hands that held, the lips that kissed
Nothing stays, yet nothing is missed
Winds of change, everthey persist

In the heart, a single truth lies
Love is a flame that never dies
Though separated by endless miles
Love remains, present all the while

8. Instruction: Describe how phosphorescent materials work and give one example of a practical application for them.
8. Input: 
<noinput>
8. Output: 
Phosphorescent materials work by absorbing energy from a light source and then releasing that energy over time in the form of visible light. These materials have a "glow-in-the-dark" effect as their electrons are energized and raised to a higher state by absorbed photons, then slowly return to their ground state, emitting light in the process. One practical application of phosphorescent materials is in safety signs or exit signs, which can guide people to safety in low-light or emergency situations without relying on active illumination.9.
