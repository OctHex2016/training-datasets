7. Instruction: Describe the chemical process of photosynthesis.
7. Input: 
<noinput>
7. Output: 
Photosynthesis is a chemical process in which green plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. It occurs in two stages, the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, photons are absorbed by pigments in the chloroplasts, generating ATP and NADPH. In the light-independent Calvin cycle, the energy derived from ATP and NADPH is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose and other sugars.

14. Instruction: Compare and contrast aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
14. Input: 
<noinput>
14. Output: 
Aerobic respiration requires oxygen and produces a relatively high amount of ATP (energy) from glucose. It occurs in three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. By-products include carbon dioxide and water.

Anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen and produces a relatively low amount of ATP from glucose. It consists of only the glycolysis stage, and its by-products include lactic acid or ethanol, depending on the organism. Anaerobic respiration is less efficient but occurs in oxygen-deprived conditions.
