14. Instruction: Write an explanation of the difference between machine learning and deep learning in less than 100 words.
14. Input: 
<noinput>
14. Output: 
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on that data. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze complex relationships in data. Essentially, deep learning encompasses machine learning but can handle more complex tasks and larger amounts of data. It uses a layered architecture to automatically learn features from the data, without relying on human-crafted features.
