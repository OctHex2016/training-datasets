7. Instruction: Write a one-paragraph summary of the scientific theory of evolution by natural selection. 
7. Input: 
<noinput>
7. Output: 
The theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the most profound scientific theories of all time. It explains how all living organisms on earth today are descended from a common ancestor that lived over 3 billion years ago. The basic idea is that organisms that are better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to their offspring. Over time, this process of natural selection leads to the evolution of new species with unique adaptations to their environment. While evolution is still a topic of debate and controversy in some circles, the evidence for natural selection and its role in shaping the diversity of life on earth is overwhelming.

While they may look very similar, there are several key differences between crocodiles and alligators. Both are large, carnivorous reptiles with long snouts and lots of sharp teeth, but crocs tend to be more aggressive and territorial than gators. Crocodile snouts are usually V-shaped and pointed, while alligator snouts are more U-shaped and rounded. Alligators also tend to be more tolerant of cold weather and can be found in more northern areas than crocs. When it comes to behavior and habitat, the two species are somewhat different, but they share many common traits and are both fascinating animals to observe in the wild.

10. Instruction: Rewrite the following paragraph using simpler language. 
10. Input: 
Although the vast majority of people agree that climate change is a serious problem, there are still some skeptics and deniers out there who claim that the evidence is inconclusive or simply false. However, the scientific consensus is clear: the earth is getting warmer due to human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, and this is causing a range of negative effects like rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity. In order to address these complex challenges, we need to take bold action to reduce our carbon footprint, promote renewable energy sources, and protect natural habitats and ecosystems.
10. Output: 
Many people believe that climate change is a big problem, but some people still don't agree because they think the proof isn't clear. Scientists say that people are making the earth warmer by doing things like making pollution and cutting down trees. This is causing lots of problems like the sea getting higher, the weather getting worse, and animals losing their homes. To solve these problems, we need to use less dirty energy, use more clean energy, and protect the environment.
