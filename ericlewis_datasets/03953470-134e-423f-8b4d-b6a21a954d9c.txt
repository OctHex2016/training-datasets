4. Instruction: Rewrite this paragraph by translating the idiomatic expressions into their literal meanings.
4. Input:
It's raining cats and dogs outside, which will really throw a wrench into our plans for the picnic. I hope this doesn't become the straw that breaks the camel's back in terms of conflicts this week.
4. Output:
It's raining heavily outside, which will really cause problems for our plans for the picnic. I hope this doesn't become the final small burden that causes a bigger catastrophe in terms of conflicts this week.

5. Instruction: Compare and contrast the main differences between debit and credit cards.
5. Input: <noinput>
5. Output:
Debit cards allow cardholders to spend money from their checking account without using checks or making cash withdrawals. Credit cards, on the other hand, let users borrow money up to a certain limit to make payments or purchases. The key differences include:

1. Funds Source: Debit cards use the money available in the cardholder's checking account, while credit cards use a line of credit provided by the issuer.
2. Interest and Fees: Debit cards generally do not have interest charges, whereas credit cards may charge interest on outstanding balances not paid in full each month. Credit cards also have annual fees and late payment fees.
3. Credit Building: Using a credit card responsibly can help build or improve credit scores, whereas using a debit card typically has no impact on credit history.
4. Fraud Liability: Credit cards usually offer better protection against fraud and unauthorized transactions, with limited consumer liability in such cases. Debit cards may have higher liability depending on when the fraud is reported.

6. Instruction: Write a haiku about nature.
6. Input: <noinput>
6. Output:
Gentle winds whisper,
Mountains touch the sky above,
Nature's harmony.

7. Instruction: Summarize the following passage.
7. Input:
Despite being surrounded by water, Antarctica is largely considered a desert because of its low precipitation. In fact, Antarctica holds the title of the Earth's largest desert, followed by the Arctic and the Sahara. The reason behind the low precipitation in Antarctica is due to its extremely cold climate. Even though there is snow falling, these are basically ice crystals that are formed from freezing atmospheric moisture. The precipitation rate in the central parts of Antarctica is typically less than 50 millimeters per year.
7. Output:
Antarctica is considered Earth's largest desert due to its low precipitation levels, caused by its extremely cold climate. Snowfall in this region consists of ice crystals formed from frozen atmospheric moisture, resulting in less than 50 millimeters of precipitation annually in central Antarctica.

8. Instruction: Describe the use of Fibonacci numbers in nature.
8. Input: <noinput>
8. Output:
Fibonacci numbers appear in various aspects of nature, often related to growth patterns and proportionality. Some examples include:

1. Plants: The arrangement of leaves, petals, and seed heads in plants often adheres to Fibonacci sequences, promoting efficient use of sunlight, moisture, and spacing.
2. Pine Cones and Pineapples: The spirals formed by their scales or seeds follow a Fibonacci sequence.
3. Shells: The chambered nautilus shell grows in a spiral pattern that can be described by Fibonacci numbers or the related golden ratio.
4. Animal Breeding: The population growth in idealized cases such as rabbit or bee colonies over generations can be modeled with Fibonacci numbers.

These natural occurrences make the Fibonacci sequence a fascinating mathematical concept with real-world applications.
