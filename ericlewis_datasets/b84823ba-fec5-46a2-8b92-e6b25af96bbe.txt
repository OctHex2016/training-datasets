Renewable energy sources are those that can be naturally replenished within a relatively short period of time, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. Non-renewable energy sources, on the other hand, include fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as nuclear energy. These sources are finite and cannot be replenished within a human timescale, meaning they will eventually run out.
