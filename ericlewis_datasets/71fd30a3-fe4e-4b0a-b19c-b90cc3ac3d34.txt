Verse 1: 
I feel the wind of change is setting in
My time's almost up, I'm coming to an end
But before I close this chapter of life
I'll take you on a journey through my mind

Chorus: 
I'll celebrate my memories and the ones I love
I won't fear the reaper, looking down from above
I'll say my goodbyes and make peace with fate
Embrace the end, before it's too late

Verse 2: 
I know that I must leave this place
I'll look back at my life without a trace
But I won't go down without a fight
I'll hold my head up, facing the light

Chorus: 
I'll celebrate my memories and the ones I love
I won't fear the reaper, looking down from above
I'll say my goodbyes and make peace with fate
Embrace the end, before it's too late

Bridge: 
I'm not afraid, I'll take a stand
I'll leave my mark in the sand
I'll go down swinging, giving it all
I'll answer the call, when heaven calls

Chorus: 
I'll celebrate my memories and the ones I love
I won't fear the reaper, looking down from above
I'll say my goodbyes and make peace with fate
Embrace the end, before it's too late

Outro: 
I'll celebrate my memories and the ones I love
I'll make my peace with the ones above
I'll slip away into the night
But my spirit will burn, shining bright
