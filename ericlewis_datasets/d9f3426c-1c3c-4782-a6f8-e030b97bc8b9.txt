Hi [Boyfriend's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I've had some time to reflect on our relationship, and I find it necessary to address some issues with you. Over time, we have both grown and developed individually, which has ultimately shifted our compatibility. Our priorities, values, and expectations for the future seem to be moving in different directions. It's been a difficult decision, but I feel it's best for us to part ways at this point.

I want you to know that there have been some beautiful moments in our journey together, and I cherish those memories. This decision is not meant to discredit the great times we've had, but rather to acknowledge that we both deserve the opportunity to find happiness with people who align more closely with our individual paths.

I hope we can both walk away from this as stronger, better, and happier individuals. I wish you nothing but the best in your future endeavors. Thank you for being a part of my life.

Warmest regards,
[Your Name]
