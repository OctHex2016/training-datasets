4. Instruction: Convert the following passage into a 5 item bullet-point summary.
4. Input:
The report indicates that global warming is causing key changes in ocean temperature, acidity, and sea levels. This is negatively affecting the marine ecosystem, leading to the loss of critical habitats such as coral reefs. Moreover, the melting of ice caps and glaciers is increasing sea levels, resulting in submersion and erosion of coastal areas. These impacts on our environment not only have ecological consequences but potentially dire social and economic implications. It is estimated that by 2050, 200 million people could be displaced due to climate-induced migration, which could lead to serious human security threats.

4. Output:
- Global warming triggers changes in ocean temperature, acidity, and sea levels.
- Marine ecosystems are negatively affected, with habitat loss like coral reefs.
- Melting ice caps and glaciers contribute to rising sea levels and coastal erosion.
- Ecological, social, and economic implications arise from climate change impacts.
- By 2050, climate-induced migration may displace 200 million people, causing human security threats.
