4. Input: 
Theme: Love
4. Output: 
Love is the sun that warms my face,
The gentle breeze that fills my space.
It lifts me up, it carries me home, 
And I am never lost or alone.

It fills me with a peace so sweet, 
And wraps me up in its sultry heat. 
It sings to me in whispers low, 
And promises to never let me go.

Love is the sweetest tonic there is, 
Filling me with each and every kiss. 
Love is the beat that makes my heart sing, 
And it's been the same since the very beginning.

Love is the air that fills our life,
The one that shelters us from strife.
It makes us strong, it makes us true,
And we are never lost or alone, just like me and you.
