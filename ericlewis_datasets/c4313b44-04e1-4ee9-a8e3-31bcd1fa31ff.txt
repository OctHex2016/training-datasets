###
13. Instruction: Explain the greenhouse effect and how it is related to global warming.
13. Input:
<noinput>
13. Output:
The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in Earth's atmosphere, called greenhouse gases, trap heat from the sun and help maintain a stable temperature on our planet. These gases include carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), water vapor (H₂O), and nitrous oxide (N₂O).

The relation between the greenhouse effect and global warming arises from the increased concentration of these greenhouse gases due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. This enhanced greenhouse effect amplifies the heat-trapping capacity of the atmosphere, leading to a rise in Earth's average temperature, a phenomenon known as global warming. This temperature increase has adverse consequences, like climate change, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity.

16. Input:
<noinput>
16. Output:
Renewable energy sources are those that can be replenished naturally in a relatively short amount of time. Examples include solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy. These sources are more environmentally friendly, as they produce little or no greenhouse gas emissions.

Non-renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are finite and cannot be renewed within a human time scale. Examples include fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Burning these fuels releases harmful emissions and contributes to climate change. Additionally, the extraction of non-renewable energy can cause significant ecological damage.
