Global warming is a long-term process of rising average temperature of the Earth's landmass and oceans. The major cause of this increase is the excessive release of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere, which leads to an increase in global temperatures. The consequence of this rising temperature includes extreme weather events like floods, hurricanes, and droughts, as well as loss of biodiversity and sea level rise. The increasing economic cost and humanitarian impact make it necessary for governments and industries to reduce emissions and invest in sustainable energy sources.
