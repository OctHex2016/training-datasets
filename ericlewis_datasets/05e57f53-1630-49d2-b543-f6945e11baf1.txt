Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two distinct processes that occur in living organisms. Photosynthesis is a process that occurs in plants, algae, and some bacteria, wherein sunlight's energy is utilized to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a form of sugar) and oxygen. This process stores energy in the form of glucose, which can later be used by the plant or organism for growth and other functions. Photosynthesis can be summarized as: 6CO2 + 6H2O + sunlight energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2

Cellular respiration, on the other hand, is a process where cells break down glucose to release energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used to fuel the cell's activities. Cellular respiration occurs in both plants and animals, and requires oxygen to facilitate the breakdown of glucose. During this process, water and carbon dioxide are produced as waste products. Cellular respiration can be summarized as: C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP

The key differences between these two processes are:
1. Photosynthesis is an energy-storing process, while cellular respiration is an energy-releasing process.
2. Photosynthesis occurs only in plants, algae, and certain bacteria, while cellular respiration occurs in all living organisms.
3. The reactants and products of each process are reversed; photosynthesis produces glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water, while cellular respiration produces carbon dioxide and water from glucose and oxygen.
