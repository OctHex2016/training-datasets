Climb the highest mountains, never losing the race,

We learn from our struggles, develop wisdom,
Rising like a phoenix, soaring through the sky,
Chasing our dreams, never let'em just die.

Overcome the odds, like setting sun,
Facing every challenge, fearless all along,
Resilience in our hearts, where we belong.
