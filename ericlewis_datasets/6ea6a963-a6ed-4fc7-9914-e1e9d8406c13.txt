As leaves turn gold and red and brown,
And gently tumble to the ground,
The crunch beneath our feet we hear,
As autumn's beauty draws so near.

The air is crisp, relief from heat,
And cozy sweaters now we'll meet,
With pumpkin spice and apple pies,
We cherish the season, no goodbyes.

So let us cherish autumn's hues,
Before winter comes to takeover.
Let's embrace the beauty of fall,
Promise to return next year's call.
