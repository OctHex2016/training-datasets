5. Instruction: Edit the following paragraph to make it more formal and academic.
5. Input: 
People in their 20s are facing different challenges than their parents did. Today's political and economical situations are holding them back from starting a family and having babies. Lucinda, an expert on this topic, states that those old-fashioned family dreams are quickly becoming a fantasy. 
5. Output: 
Individuals in their twenties confront distinct challenges compared to previous generations. Contemporary political and economic circumstances impede their ability to initiate families and raise children. Lucinda, a specialist in this domain, posits that traditional family aspirations are rapidly evolving into unattainable fantasies.

6. Instruction: Summarize the primary points of the given text in 50 words or less.
6. Input: 
Climate change is one of the most critical challenges facing humanity today. Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning have caused a significant increase in global temperatures, leading to a variety of harmful effects on ecosystems and human populations. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has set forth various measures to combat this issue, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to clean energy sources, and implementing strategic policies worldwide. Failure to address climate change adequately and promptly will lead to severe consequences for both current and future generations.
6. Output: 
Climate change, driven by carbon emissions, threatens ecosystems and human populations. The IPCC recommends reducing emissions, adopting clean energy, and implementing global policies. Inaction will result in severe consequences for present and future generations.
