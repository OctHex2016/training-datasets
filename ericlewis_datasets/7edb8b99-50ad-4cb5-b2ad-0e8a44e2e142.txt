George Washington, the first President of the United States, was born on February 22, 1732, in Westmoreland County, Virginia.

Washington gained national prominence for his involvement in the American Revolutionary War, where he was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. He played a crucial role in securing American independence by leading his troops to victory, most notably in the famous crossing of the Delaware River and the Siege of Yorktown.

After the war, Washington presided at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, where he played an essential part in shaping the fledgling United States government. In 1789, he was unanimously elected as the first President of the United States, serving for two terms from 1789 to 1797.

He died on December 14, 1799, at his plantation in Mount Vernon and is remembered for his steadfast leadership and devotion to his country.

<noinput>
7. Output: 
Once upon a time, in the African grasslands, a swift cheetah and a determined wildebeest decided to have a race. The cheetah, known for its incredible speed, was confident that it would effortlessly win the contest. On the other hand, the wildebeest was well aware of the cheetah's power but remained focused and undeterred.

The race began, and as expected, the cheetah shot ahead like a lightning bolt, leaving the wildebeest far behind. The cheetah was so certain of its victory that it decided to take a leisurely break under the shade of an Acacia tree, sure that it could easily catch up later. While the cheetah rested, the wildebeest maintained a steady pace, never taking a break, and toiling along the course.

Finally, when the cheetah woke up from its rest, it realized that the wildebeest had already reached the finish line. The cheetah sprinted with all its might, but it was too late. The wildebeest had won the race. So, the moral of the story is: "Slow and steady wins the race."
