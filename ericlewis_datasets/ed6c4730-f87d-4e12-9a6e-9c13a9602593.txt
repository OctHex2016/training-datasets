7. Instruction: Summarize the given article in two sentences.
7. Input: 
Researchers have made a breakthrough discovery of an enzyme in the gut that plays a significant role in sugar metabolism. This discovery could potentially lead to the development of new treatments for obesity and diabetes. The enzyme, called Flavonolase, works by breaking down sugar molecules, which helps regulate blood sugar levels and prevents excess sugar accumulation in the body. In a series of experiments conducted on mice, the scientists observed that mice with higher levels of Flavonolase had reduced weight gain and improved glucose tolerance compared to the control group. The research team believes that targeting this enzyme could pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches in the fight against obesity and diabetes.
