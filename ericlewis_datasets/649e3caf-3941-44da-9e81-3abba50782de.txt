Informative programming languages are used for artificial intelligence (AI) and expert systems. Informative languages are declarative instead of procedural, and they focus on what the user intends before the algorithm explains the proposed task. Examples of these languages include Prolog, Lisp, and Mercury. Some benefits of using informative languages include the logical representations of data, better approaches to problem-solving, and a higher level of abstraction.

12. Instruction: Describe the process of photosynthesis in plants.

12. Input:
<noinput>

12. Output:
Photosynthesis is a process in which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. It occurs in chloroplasts, where the light-dependent reactions absorb light energy and produce ATP and NADPH. These energy-rich molecules are used during the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) to fix carbon dioxide into glucose, which the plant can use for energy or store for later use. Oxygen is released as a byproduct.

13. Instruction: Give a brief explanation of how blockchain technology works.

13. Input:
<noinput>

Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that stores transaction data in blocks. Transactions are encrypted, verified, and added to the blockchain by a network of computers, called nodes. Each node possesses a copy of the blockchain, and once a block is added, it cannot be altered. This immutability and transparency make blockchains secure and resistant to fraud, making them ideal for applications in finance, data management, and supply chain tracking.
