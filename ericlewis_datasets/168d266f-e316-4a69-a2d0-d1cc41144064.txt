Over a billion people around the world lack access to clean drinking water, but an innovative new technology could help remedy that problem. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have unveiled a device that uses sunlight to purify water in a rapid, efficient, and cost-effective manner. The solar-powered system works by evaporating contaminated water, leaving behind impurities such as microbes, bacteria, and other pollutants, and then condenses the steam back into clean, drinkable water. This process could provide a portable and affordable source of clean water for remote or impoverished communities. The MIT team estimates that the device could purify up to 60 liters of water per hour when scaled up, with each unit costing approximately $100.
