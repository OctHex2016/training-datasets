Bitcoin is a digital or virtual currency created in 2009 that uses peer-to-peer technology to facilitate instant payments. It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity has yet to be verified. The appeal of Bitcoin lies in its promise to provide low-cost, high-speed transactions without the need for a bank or other centralized authority. Bitcoin's efficiency comes from its underlying technology: the blockchain, a public ledger of all transactions. It is decentralized and transparent, so it is not controlled by any one person or organization. However, critics are concerned about its volatility, among other risks. High-profile hacks, for instance, have led some to doubt the security of the currency. Additionally, critics argue that it can be used for illegal activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and more.
