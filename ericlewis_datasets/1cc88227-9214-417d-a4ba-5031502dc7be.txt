4. Input: 
Question: What is machine learning and how does it work? 
4. Output: 
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This is achieved through the use of algorithms that are trained on large datasets, allowing the machine learning models to recognize patterns and make predictions with increasing accuracy over time. Some common applications of machine learning include image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.
