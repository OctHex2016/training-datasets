On a stormy night in a small town, Detective Anna Kowalski was investigating the murder of a wealthy businessman named Thomas. The crime took place in Thomas's lavish mansion. The lone witness was his blind butler, James, who claimed to have heard the murderer's footsteps and a muffled gunshot from his room.

As Anna meticulously scoured the mansion, she discovered that the safe containing valuable secrets was left untouched, indicating a personal motive. James informed Anna about Thomas's estranged brother Richard who constantly fought with Thomas over their father's inheritance.

Anna soon discovered Richard arriving in town earlier that day. Approaching him, Anna noticed his muddy boots, which were similar to the prints found at the crime scene. She recalled James mentioning the perpetrator's nervous gait. Bringing Richard to the mansion, Anna asked James to stand beside a wall, while Richard walked back and forth.

Closing her eyes, Anna synchronized her ears with James's, listening intently to Richard's footsteps. The nervous patterns and hesitations confirmed the blind butler's description. After presenting the evidence, Richard confessed to the murder, vindicating the unseen witness.
