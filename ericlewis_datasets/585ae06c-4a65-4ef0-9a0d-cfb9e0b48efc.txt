4. Instruction: Convert the given recipe instructions into a numbered list.
4. Input: 
Preheat the oven to 375째F (190째C). In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work it into the dry ingredients until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in the chocolate chips. Add the buttermilk and mix until just combined. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it gently a few times. Pat the dough down into a circle about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, then cut the circle into 8 wedges. Transfer the scones to a parchment-lined baking sheet and brush the tops with a little bit of buttermilk. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until lightly golden.

8. Input: 
Solar panel technology has seen rapid advancements in the last decade, paving the way for more affordable and efficient installations. According to an International Energy Agency report, solar energy is now the cheapest form of electricity generation in history. This is due to significant reductions in manufacturing costs and improvements in efficiency. The steep decline in costs has led to a surge in solar installations worldwide, with China, the United States, and India leading the charge. Additionally, advances in energy storage, such as lithium-ion batteries, have made solar power a more viable solution for off-grid communities and energy backup systems.

9. Instruction: Provide a brief history of the invention and development of mobile phones.
9. Input: <noinput>
9. Output: 
Mobile phones were first invented in 1973 by Motorola's Martin Cooper, who made the first-ever handheld cellular phone call. By the 1980s, mobile phones were commercially available but were large, expensive, and had limited functionality. The 1990s saw a decrease in size and cost and an increase in functionality, including text messaging and basic gaming. In 2000, Nokia released the popular 3310 model, known for its durability and long battery life. The 2007 release of Apple's iPhone revolutionized mobile devices by introducing touchscreen technology and mobile applications. Continued innovation in the following years led to the rise of smartphones, which now dominate the market and offer advanced features like cameras, GPS, and internet access.

10. Instruction: Explain the impact of the greenhouse effect on global warming. Also, mention some ways to mitigate it.
10. Input: <noinput>
10. Output: 
The greenhouse effect is the process by which certain gases in Earth's atmosphere, like carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat and contribute to global warming. This leads to rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and negative impacts on ecosystems and human well-being. To mitigate the greenhouse effect, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by adopting cleaner energy sources like solar and wind, increasing energy efficiency, implementing better waste management practices, and protecting forests, which absorb carbon dioxide. Individuals can also make sustainable choices, like using public transportation, adopting a plant-based diet, and conserving energy at home.
