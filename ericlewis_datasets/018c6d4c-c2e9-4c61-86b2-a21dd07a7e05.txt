Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants and certain organisms like algae convert sunlight into chemical energy in the form of glucose or sugar. It occurs in chlorophyll-containing cells, primarily in the leaves.

This process not only helps plants produce their own food but also plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.
