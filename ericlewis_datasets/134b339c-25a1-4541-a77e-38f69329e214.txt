10. Input: 
<noinput>
10. Output: 
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose, a type of sugar that serves as energy for the organism. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll, a pigment found in plant cells, absorbs sunlight that the plant, algae, or bacteria take in from their environment. The energy from the sunlight is then used to combine carbon dioxide (taken from the air) and water (absorbed through roots or the environment) to produce oxygen and glucose. As a result, plants create oxygen for the environment and use glucose to grow and reproduce.
