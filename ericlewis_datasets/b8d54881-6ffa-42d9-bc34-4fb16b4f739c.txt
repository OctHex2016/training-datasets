5. Instruction: Provide a brief summary of the given article. 
5. Input: 
A recent study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine has found that daytime napping could greatly improve memory consolidation, leading to enhanced memory recall. The study involved undergraduate students who were divided into two groups, one who napped and one who remained awake. Both groups were required to memorize a list of words before and after a 90-minute interval. Surprisingly, the group that napped showed a 10% increase in memory recall compared to the non-napping participants. The authors of the study suggest that napping provides an opportunity for the brain to consolidate and reorganize information, leading to better memory recall.
