4. Instruction: Summarize the provided passage in one sentence.
4. Input: 
Plastic pollution in the ocean is a major problem, causing harm to marine life, birds, and coastal communities. A significant amount of plastic waste makes its way into the ocean through rivers, waterways, and storm drains. Once in the ocean, it can take hundreds or even thousands of years to break down, causing lasting harm to the delicate marine ecosystems. Microplastics, tiny fragments of plastic less than five millimeters in size, are particularly dangerous because they can accumulate in various organisms and work their way up the food chain, eventually ending up on our dinner plates.
4. Output: 
Ocean plastic pollution threatens marine ecosystems, wildlife, and human health due to its long degradation process and the accumulation of microplastics in the food chain.
