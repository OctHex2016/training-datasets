7. Instruction: Explain the differences between plant cells and animal cells.
7. Input: 
<noinput>
7. Output: 
Plant cells and animal cells share similarities, but they also have several key differences. Plant cells have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, while animal cells do not have a cell wall, only a cell membrane. Plant cells also contain chloroplasts for photosynthesis, which are absent in animal cells. Another distinguishing factor is that plant cells have large central vacuoles for storing water and nutrients, whereas animal cells have smaller vacuoles, if present at all. Animal cells are usually round in shape, while plant cells have a more rectangular appearance due to their cell wall.

###
8. Instruction: Provide two pros and two cons of using nuclear energy as a power source.
8. Input: 
<noinput>
8. Output: 
Pros:
1. Nuclear energy produces low greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel-based power plants, so it contributes less to climate change.
2. Nuclear power plants typically have a high energy output, providing a large and stable energy supply with relatively small amounts of fuel.

Cons:
1. Disposal of nuclear waste is a significant issue; it remains radioactive and hazardous for thousands of years and requires safe, long-term storage facilities.
2. The risk of nuclear accidents, such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, poses significant environmental and health concerns if containment fails.

###
11. Instruction: Write an unbiased passage comparing renewable and non-renewable energy sources.
11. Input: 
<noinput>
11. Output: 
Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydro power, are sustainable, inexhaustible options for generating electricity. They have minimal environmental impact and contribute less to climate change, as they produce low greenhouse gas emissions compared to non-renewable sources. However, renewable energy generation can be less predictable due to weather conditions, and the current infrastructure required for storage and output lags behind non-renewable methods.

Non-renewable energy sources, like coal, oil, and natural gas, are finite resources relied upon for the majority of global energy consumption. Non-renewable energy plants often have a high energy output and provide a stable power supply. Yet, they also emit significant greenhouse gases and other pollutants, contributing to global warming, air pollution, and environmental degradation. Additionally, the extraction, transportation, and processing of these resources can harm ecosystems and local communities.

Both renewable and non-renewable energy sources have advantages and drawbacks to consider when assessing their viability in current and future energy systems.
