4. Instruction: Summarize the main argument and conclusion of the text. 
4. Input: 
Many people believe that the key to happiness is accumulating material possessions. However, recent studies have shown that experiences, not possessions, actually bring greater life satisfaction. This is because experiences generate positive memories and foster connections with others, expanding our sense of self. Additionally, the novelty of experiences stimulates personal growth, whereas material possessions lose their appeal over time. Furthermore, people tend to adapt to the level of material wealth they possess, making it difficult to find lasting happiness in accumulating more. In conclusion, seeking experiences rather than material possessions is a more effective path to happiness.
4. Output: 
The main argument is that experiences bring greater life satisfaction than material possessions due to positive memories, self-expansion, and personal growth. The conclusion is that seeking experiences, rather than material wealth, leads to a more effective path to happiness.
