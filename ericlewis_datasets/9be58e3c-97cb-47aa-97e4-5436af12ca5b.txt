<noinput>

Social media has transformed the way we communicate, share information and interact with each other. While it has revolutionized access to information and provided a powerful platform for activism and advocacy, it has also enabled the spread of misinformation, radicalization and cyberbullying. Social media algorithms create echo-chambers and filter bubbles, reinforcing our biases and limiting the exchange of diverse perspectives. Furthermore, social media addiction has led to increased anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders among users. Despite these challenges, social media remains a powerful tool that can be harnessed for social change and connecting with like-minded people. The key is to regulate social media content, educate users on digital citizenship and use social media in a responsible and meaningful way.

20. Input: 
<noinput>
20. Output: 
Unrequited love, the sweetest pain,
The heart that aches in vain.
For reasons beyond our might,
Our feelings cast aside like light.
We dream of that which we can't grasp,
A one-sided love that cannot last.
With each rejection we grow more strong,
Cherishing what cannot belong. 
For love is not a gift that's given, 
But it's the reason we keep livin'.
