<noinput>
6. Output:
1. Wood: Wood is a common material used in the construction of residential buildings, particularly in wood framing, sheathing, and roofing. Wooden structures are usually lightweight, durable, and easy to work with, making it a popular choice in residential construction.
2. Concrete: Often used in the construction of foundations, walls, and floor slabs, concrete provides strength, rigidity, and load-bearing capabilities to residential buildings. Reinforced concrete, created by incorporating steel reinforcing bars (rebar) into the structure, offers enhanced performance and support.
3. Brick and Masonry: Brick and masonry materials, which include concrete blocks and natural or manufactured stones, are commonly used in the construction of residential buildings for their durability, low maintenance, and aesthetic appeal. These materials are often utilized for exterior walls or as a structural component in combination with other materials, such as wood or steel framing.
