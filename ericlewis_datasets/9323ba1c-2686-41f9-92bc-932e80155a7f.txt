8. Instruction: Explain the differences between a secured and an unsecured loan.
8. Input:
<noinput>
8. Output: 
A secured loan is a type of loan that requires the borrower to provide some form of collateral, such as a property or vehicle, as a guarantee for repayment. This reduces the risk for the lender, often resulting in lower interest rates. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender can seize the collateral to recover their losses.

An unsecured loan, on the other hand, does not require collateral. Since there is no guarantee for repayment, lenders typically charge higher interest rates to offset the increased risk. These loans often rely on the borrower's credit score and income for approval, and defaulting on an unsecured loan can negatively impact one's credit rating.
