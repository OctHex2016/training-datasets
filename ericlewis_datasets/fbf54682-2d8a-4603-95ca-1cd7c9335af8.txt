8. Instruction: Describe the process of photosynthesis in plants.
8. Input: 
<noinput>
8. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into energy in the form of glucose and oxygen. In the presence of sunlight, chlorophyll, a pigment in plant cells, absorbs and transforms light energy into chemical energy. During the light-dependent reactions, water molecules are split, releasing oxygen and hydrogen ions. Then, the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, take place, during which carbon dioxide is fixed into a carbohydrate using chemical energy produced earlier. This whole process allows plants to generate glucose for growth and maintenance while releasing oxygen as a byproduct.
