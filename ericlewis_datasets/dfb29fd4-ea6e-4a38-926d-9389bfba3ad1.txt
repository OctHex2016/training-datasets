20. Input:
Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening

Whose woods these are I think I know. 
His house is in the village, though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.

- Robert Frost
20. Output:
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" by Robert Frost presents the central theme of the struggle between the allure of nature's beauty and the responsibilities we have in life. The speaker, captivated by the tranquil snow-filled woods, is reminded of the promises and obligations he must fulfill, pulling him away from the enchanting scene. The poem highlights the tension between one's desire for serenity and the demands of reality.
