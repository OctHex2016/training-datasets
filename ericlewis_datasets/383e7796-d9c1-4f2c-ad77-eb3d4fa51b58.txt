18. Instruction: Write a brief history of the Internet.
18. Input: 
<noinput>
18. Output: 
The Internet's history dates back to the 1960s when the United States Department of Defense developed the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) to enable communication among military research institutions. ARPANET expanded in the 1970s and inspired the development of important protocols such as TCP/IP by researchers Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn.

In the 1980s, ARPANET began to transition towards civilian use, giving rise to the modern Internet. In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, created the World Wide Web (WWW) – a system of linked hypertext documents accessible via the Internet. The World Wide Web's release to the public in 1991 marked the beginning of popular Internet usage.

Throughout its existence, the Internet has experienced significant expansion and innovation, including increasing use of commercial services, development of social media platforms, and the growth of e-commerce, transforming almost every aspect of modern life.
