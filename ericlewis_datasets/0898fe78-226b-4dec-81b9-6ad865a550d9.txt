4. Instruction: Summarize the given news article. 
4. Input: 
"Researchers from the University of Melbourne and Monash University have discovered a new method for producing hydrogen with an energy-efficient and affordable catalyst. The catalyst consists of tiny clusters of gold nano-particles, which are efficient at breaking the bond between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in water molecules. The team found that under normal room temperature conditions, the new catalyst greatly sped up the chemical processes required to produce hydrogen gas, potentially leading to an abundant and sustainable energy source. According to the researchers, this discovery could facilitate the wide-scale adoption of hydrogen fuel cells as an alternative energy source. The team will now look for industrial partners to commercialize their innovation."
4. Output:
