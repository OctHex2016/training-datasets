Recently, a new study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science, suggesting that the increasing carbon dioxide levels in the ocean are already impacting marine life. The researchers studied coral reefs located off the coast of Australia, specifically the Great Barrier Reef, and found that the changing ocean conditions may lead to the decline of fish population. The fish found in these areas may have difficulty with both growth and reproduction, which can cause a disruption to the overall marine ecosystem. The scientists called for urgent action to mitigate the effects of ocean acidification and protect marine life.

16. Input:
<noinput>
16. Output:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy to fuel their growth. Firstly, chlorophyll inside the plant cells absorbs the sun's light. Then, the light energy is used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen gas as a byproduct. This process also generates a molecule called ATP that provides energy for cellular processes. Next, plants use the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to produce glucose through a series of chemical reactions collectively called the Calvin cycle. Glucose is used as an energy source or building material, allowing plants to grow.
