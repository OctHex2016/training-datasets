19. Input: 
<noinput>

This process generates oxygen (O2) as a byproduct, which is released into the atmosphere, and glucose (C6H12O6) which is used for the plant's growth and development.

Title: Effects of Social Media on Mental Health: A Longitudinal Study

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of social media usage on mental health in a longitudinal study, with a focus on anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. Data were collected from participants through online questionnaires over a two-year period. The results show that individuals who spent excessive time on social media platforms experienced increased levels of anxiety and depression, as well as lower self-esteem. The findings suggest that addressing the factors that contribute to excessive use of social media could mitigate the negative effects on mental health.
