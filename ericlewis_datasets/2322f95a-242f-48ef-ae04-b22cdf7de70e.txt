<noinput>

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs when certain gases in Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane, trap heat radiating from the Earth's surface. These gases, called greenhouse gases, act like a blanket, allowing sunlight to enter and warm our planet, but preventing a portion of the heat from escaping back into space. This trapped heat keeps the Earth's temperature relatively stable, making it possible for life to exist. However, human activities have led to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, causing an enhanced greenhouse effect and contributing to global warming.
