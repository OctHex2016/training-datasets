To break a bad habit and develop a good one, follow these steps:

3. Create a plan to replace the bad habit with the new habit by altering the routine. For example, when the trigger occurs, consciously engage in the new habit instead of the bad one.

5. Seek support from friends, family, or accountability partners, and share your goals with them.
