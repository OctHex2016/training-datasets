5. Instruction: Identify the main idea of the given paragraph.
5. Input: 
Earthquakes are one of the most destructive natural disasters. They occur when tectonic plates grind or slip past each other at a fault line. This causes vibrations, or seismic waves, that travel through the Earth's crust, shaking the Earth's surface. The intensity of an earthquake depends on how much energy is released at its source, known as the focus or hypocenter. The location directly above the focus is called the epicenter, which is often the most affected area. Earthquakes can result in extensive damage to infrastructure, loss of human life, and long-term economic consequences.
5. Output: 
The main idea of the paragraph is that earthquakes are destructive natural disasters caused by the movement of tectonic plates and can lead to significant damage and consequences.
