5. Instruction: Summarize the following text about climate change.
5. Input:
Climate change refers to the long-term alterations in the Earth's climate patterns, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind, over the span of many decades or longer. Climate change is caused primarily by an increase of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which are released into the atmosphere through human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. As a result, the Earth's average temperature rises, leading to more extreme weather, rising sea levels, and adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. To mitigate the consequences of climate change, actions such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable land use are crucial.
5. Output:
Climate change, a long-term shift in Earth's climate patterns, is caused mainly by greenhouse gas emissions from human activities like fossil fuel burning, deforestation, and industry. It results in increased global temperatures, extreme weather, rising sea levels, and negative impacts on ecosystems and human health. Mitigation strategies include reducing emissions, using renewable energy, and embracing sustainable land use.

9. Instruction: Explain the process of photosynthesis in brief.
9. Input:
<noinput>
9. Output:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O) into glucose and oxygen (O2). In the presence of sunlight, plants use chlorophyll (a green pigment) in their chloroplasts to absorb light energy. This energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen combines with CO2 to form glucose, which serves as the plant's energy source, while the excess oxygen is released into the atmosphere.

10. Instruction: Calculate how many liters of paint are needed to cover a room's walls, given the dimensions and coverage per liter.
10. Input:
Room dimensions: length 6 meters, width 4 meters, height 3 meters
Paint coverage: 1 liter covers 12 square meters
10. Output:
The walls' total surface area is calculated as (2 x height x length) + (2 x height x width) = (2 x 3 x 6) + (2 x 3 x 4) = 36 + 24 = 60 square meters. With the paint covering 12 square meters per liter, you'll need 60 / 12 = 5 liters of paint to cover the room's walls.
