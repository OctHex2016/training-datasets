A semicolon is used to connect two closely related independent clauses (complete thoughts) that could stand on their own as sentences. It can also be used to improve clarity and style in writing. Here are the basic rules:

1. Connect two related independent clauses: The semicolon should be used when linking two independent clauses that are closely related in meaning or topic, making the transition smoother; for example, "I have a big test tomorrow; I can't go to the party tonight."
2. Separate items in a series with internal commas: A semicolon can be used to separate items in a list that have internal commas, providing clarity; for example, "I've been to London, England; Paris, France; and Tokyo, Japan."
