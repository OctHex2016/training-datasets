14. Instruction: Summarize the main events of the First World War in a short paragraph.
14. Input:
<noinput>
14. Output:
The First World War, also known as the Great War, began in 1914 with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, triggering a domino effect of alliances and declarations of war. The majority of the war took place between the Allies (led by France, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and the Central Powers (led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). Over the four-year conflict, battles raged on multiple fronts, the most infamous being trenches along the Western Front. Technological innovations such as machine guns, poison gas, and armored vehicles dramatically altered warfare. The United States eventually entered the war on the side of the Allies, tipping the balance. The war concluded in 1918 with the signing of the Armistice and eventually the Treaty of Versailles. The extensive loss of life and destruction resulted in major geopolitical changes, setting the stage for World War II.
