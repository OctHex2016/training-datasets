4. Output: 
A coral reef ecosystem is a complex underwater community composed of a variety of living organisms, including coral polyps, algae, and numerous species of fish and invertebrates. These ecosystems are often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea" due to their high biodiversity and productivity. Coral reefs provide essential habitats for many marine species, offering protection, shelter, and food sources. They also act as natural barriers, reducing coastal erosion and protecting shorelines from storms and waves. Additionally, coral reefs support various industries such as tourism, fisheries, and medical research, contributing to the economies of many coastal countries.
