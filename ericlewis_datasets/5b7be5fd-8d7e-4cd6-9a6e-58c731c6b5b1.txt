6. Instruction: Please provide a brief summary of the given text.
6. Input: 
As the world's population continues to grow, food security has become a pressing issue for governments and organizations. The need for sustainable farming and agricultural practices has never been more apparent. Traditional farming methods, like monocropping and the excessive use of chemical fertilizers, have led to soil depletion, water pollution, and a loss of biodiversity. This has prompted the adoption of sustainable farming practices, such as crop rotation, organic farming, and agroforestry. These more environmentally-friendly methods can preserve soil fertility, restore habitats for wildlife, and help to mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon in plants and soil.
