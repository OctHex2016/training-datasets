10. Instruction: Describe the process of photosynthesis.
10. Input: <noinput>
10. Output:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose, a form of energy. This process occurs in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll pigments in the plant’s chloroplasts absorb sunlight, which is converted to chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. These molecules are used in the light-independent reactions, where carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. Overall, this process allows plants to harness solar energy, providing energy for themselves and oxygen for other living organisms.
