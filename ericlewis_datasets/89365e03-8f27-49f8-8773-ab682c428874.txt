A melodious song, the river sings,
Through the forests, around stones it springs.
A canvas of colors upon the land,
Nature weaves its magic, with an unseen hand.

The sun kisses mountains, peaks, they gleam,
A dance of shadows and light, it does seem.
Beneath the sky, a cosmic display,
The soul of Earth, in beauty, lay.

Eating whole grains is healthier than consuming refined grains because whole grains retain their natural nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber. On the other hand, the refining process removes the bran and germ layers from the grain, stripping away essential nutrients. As a result, whole grains provide more health benefits, including better digestion, improved blood sugar control, and a lowered risk of certain chronic diseases.
