4. Output: 
Entropy is a measure of the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. In simple terms, it can be thought of as the amount of uncertainty or lack of predictability in a system. For example, a pile of sand has a high entropy because the individual grains are disordered and it is difficult to predict the exact location of any one grain. Conversely, a highly organized system like a crystal has low entropy because the arrangements of atoms are highly structured and predictable.
