Soft jazz music plays gently in the background, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafts in the air. People huddle in groups around small tables, warming themselves with steaming cups of coffee and hot chocolate, while conversations of all sorts fill the space. Others find solace in the corner nooks, where they quietly read books or work on their laptops.
