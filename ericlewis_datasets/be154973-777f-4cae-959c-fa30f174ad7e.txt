<noinput>
4. Output: 
One possible negative outcome of implementing Artificial Intelligence for controlling traffic lights could be an increase in traffic congestion and delays due to algorithmic errors or inefficiencies. If the AI system is not properly optimized for analyzing real-time traffic data, it might make poor decisions that could lead to longer waiting times at intersections, disrupting the flow of traffic, increasing overall travel times, and potentially leading to additional frustration and stress for drivers. Additionally, the margin of error may cause potential safety concerns as drivers might not appropriately anticipate the AI-controlled traffic lights' responses.
