10. Input: 
Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh
10. Output: 
Starry Night is a widely-recognized painting by the Dutch post-impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh. Created in 1889, the work conveys a sense of intense emotion through its swirling, exaggerated brushstrokes and intense use of color. The subject matter depicts the night sky over the peaceful village of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, focusing on the contrast between the serene village and the turbulent sky filled with stars, swirling clouds, and a bright crescent moon. The painting's style is characterized by thick, impasto strokes and bold, almost abstract shapes, reflecting van Gogh's emotional response to the scene, rather than a realistic representation of the landscape. Starry Night conveys a range of emotions, including wonderment, isolation, and possibly even despair, capturing the artist's tumultuous state of mind during his time at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum.
