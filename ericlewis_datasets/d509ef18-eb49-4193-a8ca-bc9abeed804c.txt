In the darkness of night's embrace

A glimmering veil of stardust blooms
As twilight whispers its gentle tunes

The moonâ€™s soft glow casts silver beams
Guiding lost travellers through their dreams
A cosmic dance of constellations bright
Illuminating the vastness of the night

Infinite beauty, the sky's art revealed
A celestial canvas forever unsealed
A fitting tribute to eternity's grace
In the endless splendor of the night's embrace

7. Instruction: How do honeybees communicate with each other?
7. Input: 
<noinput>
7. Output: 
Honeybees communicate with each other mainly through a unique process called "waggle dance." The waggle dance is a series of specific movements performed by a bee to convey information about the location, direction, and distance of a food source (e.g., flower nectar) or a potential new nest site. The dance involves a series of vibrating steps and circular turns, which encode the vital information. In addition to waggle dance, honeybees also communicate using pheromones and touch signals to convey messages and maintain the organization within the colony.
