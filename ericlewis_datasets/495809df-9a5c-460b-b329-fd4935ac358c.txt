4. Instruction: Summarize the key points of the following article excerpt about a new discovery in the field of quantum physics.
4. Input: 
Researchers at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) in Austria have made a groundbreaking discovery, demonstrating the possibility of quantum teleportation at a distance of over 100 kilometers. This has shattered the previous record of 25 kilometers, making it a substantial breakthrough in quantum communication. The research team used a unique entanglement-swapping process between individual photons, allowing them to entangle particles even when they were not directly linked. By successfully transmitting quantum information over such a long distance, they have set the stage for a new era in secure communication and the development of quantum networks on a global scale.
4. Output: 
Researchers at IQOQI in Austria have achieved quantum teleportation over a distance of 100 kilometers, breaking the previous record of 25 kilometers. They used entanglement-swapping between individual photons to entangle particles without direct linkage. This discovery has major implications for secure communication and the creation of global quantum networks.
