9. Instruction: Create a brief summary of the news article below.
9. Input: 
In a bid to improve road safety and reduce fuel consumption, the European Union has announced that all new cars will be required to have built-in speed limiters by 2022. In addition to the speed limiters, emergency braking, data loggers, and warning systems for driver fatigue and distraction will be made mandatory for all new vehicles from 2022.

The move has been met with mixed reactions, with road safety advocates praising the decision, while some motorists have voiced concerns over the restriction of personal freedoms. Opponents argue that speed limiters may diminish driver attentiveness, leading to an increased risk of accidents. However, the European Transport Safety Council believes the measures could save 25,000 lives within 15 years.
