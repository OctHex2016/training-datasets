4. Instruction: Summarize the main points of the input text.
4. Input:
Osteoporosis is a common bone disease that causes a reduction in bone density, making them weaker and more susceptible to fractures. The word "osteoporosis" literally means "porous bone." Bones affected by osteoporosis appear more porous than healthy bones when viewed under a microscope. The disease affects both men and women but is more common among women, especially postmenopausal women. As bones lose mass, they become fragile, more likely to break even from a mild impact or a simple fall. The most common sites of fractures are the wrist, spine, and hip. Regular exercise and a balanced diet, rich in calcium and vitamin D, contribute to the prevention of osteoporosis.
4. Output:
Osteoporosis is a widespread bone disease that reduces bone density, making them more prone to fractures. More common in women, especially postmenopausal women, this condition results in fragile bones that can break easily.
