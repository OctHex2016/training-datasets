8. Input: 
<noinput>
8. Output: 
The life cycle of a butterfly consists of four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly). Adult butterflies lay eggs on a specific host plant, and when the eggs hatch, caterpillars emerge and begin feeding on the host plant's leaves. As they grow, caterpillars shed their skin (molt) several times. When they're fully grown, they form the chrysalis, a protective casing, where they undergo metamorphosis, transforming into a butterfly. Once the transformation is complete, the adult butterfly emerges, dries its wings, and begins its life as a flying insect capable of reproduction.
