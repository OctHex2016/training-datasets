<noinput>

Photosynthesis is a process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen.

During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed and used to generate energy-rich molecules, namely ATP and NADPH. These molecules, along with carbon dioxide, are then used in the Calvin cycle to produce glucose, which serves as an energy source for the plant. Oxygen is released as a by-product of this process.
