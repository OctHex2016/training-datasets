4. Instruction: Summarize the following text. 
4. Input: 
It’s an unfortunate reality that many generations of Americans have been socialized to think of Native American tribes as monolithic entities stuck in the past. This stereotype, often perpetuated in the media and the education system, not only undermines the diverse knowledge systems and traditions held by tribes but also glosses over the fact that Native peoples were skilled farmers, traders, and builders. Indeed, the Choctaw, for example, once made up a mighty confederacy of tribes that stretched from what’s now the southeastern U.S., down into Mexico, and as far west as present-day Arizona. And the Chinook trail, followed by Lewis and Clark, would not have existed without the expertise of indigenous people.
4. Output: 
This unfortunate stereotype of Native American tribes as monolithic and stuck in the past overlooks their rich and diverse knowledge systems and traditions. It ignores their skills as farmers, traders, and builders, such as the vast Choctaw confederacy and the Chinook trail facilitated by indigenous people's expertise.
