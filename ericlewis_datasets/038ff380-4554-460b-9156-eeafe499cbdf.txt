9. Instruction: Estimate the future price of the product.
9. Input: 
Current price: $1000
Annual inflation rate: 3%
Duration: 5 years
9. Output: 
Using the simple formula for compound interest, the future price (FP) can be calculated as follows:
FP = Current price * (1 + Inflation rate)^Duration
FP = $1000 * (1 + 0.03)^5
FP = $1000 * (1.03)^5
FP = $1000 * 1.159274
FP ≈ $1159.27
In 5 years, the estimated future price of the product will be approximately $1159.27.
