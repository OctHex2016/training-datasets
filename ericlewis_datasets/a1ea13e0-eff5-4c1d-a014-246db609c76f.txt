4. Output:
Beneath the velvet skies of blue,
Where flowers and rivers gently brew,
The beauty of nature pure and bright,
A canvas of wonders, an eternal sight.

The whispers of wind through the trees,
Soft melodies of the rustling leaves,
The earth adorned in a colorful dress,
Such harmony and bounty nature does possess.

A dance of seasons, from cold to warm,
The world transformed, a mesmerizing charm,
The gentle breeze that stirs the air,
Nature's grace, a solace rare.

Embrace the splendor of this divine art,
May it warm your soul and fill your heart,
To marvel at nature's wondrous scene,
Is to glimpse heaven and wonder where we've been.
