5. Instruction: Provide a brief summary of the given passage.
5. Input: 
In recent years, serverless computing has gained popularity among various organizations for the development and deployment of cloud applications. This is mainly due to the abstraction of infrastructure, which allows companies to focus on code development and application logic. While developers no longer need to worry about managing servers, they must consider other factors such as security, scaling, and cost. Serverless computing can work well for small and medium-sized projects; however, it may not be the best solution for large-scale projects that require a high degree of customization and control over the environment.
5. Output: 
Serverless computing has become popular due to its infrastructure abstraction, allowing companies to focus on code development and application logic. However, developers must consider security, scaling, and cost factors. While suitable for small and medium-sized projects, serverless computing may not be ideal for large-scale projects needing extensive customization and environmental control.
