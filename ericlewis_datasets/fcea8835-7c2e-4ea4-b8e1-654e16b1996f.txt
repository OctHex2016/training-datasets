6. Instruction: Summarize the main findings and implications of the research paper. 
6. Input: 
Abstract: This paper examines the efficacy of a school-based selective prevention program targeting adolescent depression. Students attending two schools were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 142) or a school counseling control group (n = 178). The intervention consisted of seven 45-min group sessions conducted during regular school class time by same-gender and same-race/ethnicity school counselors trained in the group intervention. Intent-to-treat analyses showed robust and significant positive intervention effects on depression symptoms, hopelessness, and self-esteem at the conclusion of the intervention and at a 6-month follow-up. The number of students who saw mental health providers and the number prescribed psychotropic medication at posttest was higher in the control condition.
6. Output: 
This study evaluates a school-based prevention program for depression and finds that it effectively reduces symptoms and boosts self-esteem, suggesting it could be implemented on a larger scale to help tackle adolescent mental health issues.
