9. Instruction: Briefly explain the photosynthesis process in plants.
9. Input: 
<noinput>
9. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose (energy) and oxygen. It occurs in chlorophyll-containing cells called chloroplasts. There are two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed and used to generate ATP (energy) and NADPH, while the light-independent reactions use the energy and compounds from the light-dependent reactions to fix carbon dioxide and produce glucose.
