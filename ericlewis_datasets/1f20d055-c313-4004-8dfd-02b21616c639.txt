###
18. Instruction: Provide an explanation on how solar panels work.
18. Input: 
<noinput>
18. Output: 
Solar panels work by converting sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells. These cells are made of layers of semiconductor materials, typically silicon. When sunlight (photons) strikes the solar panel, it energizes the electrons in the semiconductor material, knocking them loose from their atoms. This creates a flow of electrons or electric current. The photovoltaic cells are connected together in a solar panel, which then converts the generated electric current from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) using an inverter. The converted AC electricity can then be used to power appliances and other electrical devices in homes and businesses.
