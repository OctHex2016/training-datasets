4. Input: <noinput>
4. Output:
Amidst the mighty trees and flowers in bloom,
Nature's embrace as a serene, mystic cocoon.

The birds' euphonic melodies fill the air,
While a gentle breeze whispers love and care.

With the sun overhead, its rays extending grace,
The glory of flora comes together in an embrace.

As twilight descends and stars canopy the sky,
The beauty of nature leaves us wondering why.
