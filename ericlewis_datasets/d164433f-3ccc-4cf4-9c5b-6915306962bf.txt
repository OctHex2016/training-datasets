To keep your potted plants healthy during winter months with less sunlight, follow these tips:
1. Move plants to an area with maximum natural light exposure, such as near south-facing windows. Rotate plants regularly to ensure even light distribution.
2. Clean the leaves to remove dust and maximize photosynthesis efficiency.
3. Use artificial grow lights to supplement natural light if needed.
4. Reduce watering frequency as plants tend to enter dormancy and require less water during winter.
5. Maintain stable indoor temperature and humidity levels, avoiding cold drafts or dry indoor heat.
6. Refrain from fertilizing or repotting plants during winter, as they are not in their active growth phase.
