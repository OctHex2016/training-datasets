She tried to retrace her steps, but she only ended up going deeper into the woods. Panic set in, but she knew she had to remain calm. She eventually found a clearing and set up camp for the night. She spent a restless night hoping to be found. The next morning, Mary set off on what she hoped was the right path. Eventually, she heard a search party and their calls.
