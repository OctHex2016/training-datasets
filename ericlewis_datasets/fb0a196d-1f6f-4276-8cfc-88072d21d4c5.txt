<noinput>

The water cycle consists of several interconnected processes: evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and infiltration.

Once the clouds' water droplets combine to a sufficient size, precipitation occurs in the form of rain, snow, or other forms. The precipitated water either infiltrates the ground or runs off into rivers and oceans, returning to the start of the cycle.
