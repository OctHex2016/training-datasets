7. Input:
Veganism continues to grow in popularity as more people choose plant-based diets for ethical, environmental, and health reasons. Despite misconceptions, vegan foods can be rich in essential nutrients, including protein, vitamins, and minerals. In recent years, companies have heavily invested in plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy products, resulting in a surge of innovative and accessible options. This growth is expected to continue, with global sales of plant-based food predicted to reach $74.2 billion by 2027.

Consumer preferences are constantly evolving, and the backlash against processed foods has seen a rise in demand for whole-food, plant-based diets. As vegan food becomes mainstream, companies are beginning to expand their offerings, from meat-free burgers to plant-based cheeses, to cater to the increasing demand for diverse plant-based options. With vegan culinary trends spreading across restaurants and grocery stores, traditional norms are being challenged, and the future of food appears to be plant-based.
