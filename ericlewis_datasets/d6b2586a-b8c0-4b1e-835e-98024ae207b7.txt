4. Input:
<noinput>
4. Output:
The life cycle of a butterfly consists of four stages:

1. Egg: The female butterfly lays her eggs on a host plant, suitable for the caterpillars to feed on when they hatch.
2. Larva (Caterpillar): Upon hatching, the larva emerges as a tiny caterpillar. It feeds on the host plant, molting several times and growing larger throughout this stage.
3. Pupa (Chrysalis): The caterpillar seeks a safe location to transform into a chrysalis. Inside the chrysalis, it undergoes metamorphosis, turning into a butterfly.
4. Adult (Imago): The mature butterfly emerges from the chrysalis with delicate wings. The new adult feeds on nectar and starts looking for a mate to reproduce and continue the next generation.
