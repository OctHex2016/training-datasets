4. Instruction: Write a letter to the editor about how pollution affects animal life.
4. Input: <noinput>
4. Output: 
Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my growing concern about the impact pollution is having on animal life in our community and around the world. Not only do air and water pollution deteriorate the natural habitats, but they also pose severe health risks to wildlife. Chemicals, heavy metals, and other pollutants contaminate our waterways, leading to illness and death for aquatic organisms. In turn, this disrupts the entire ecosystem and food chain.

Furthermore, air pollution, including greenhouse gases, affects bird migration patterns, disruptive mating and breeding opportunities, and overall population dynamics. Plastic waste endangers marine life, with countless sea creatures dying each year from ingesting or becoming entangled in plastic debris.

As a community, we must prioritize environmental-friendly practices in our daily lives, supporting policies that address pollution issues and protecting our precious wildlife. It is our responsibility to ensure that this planet remains a healthy and thriving place for all life forms.

Sincerely,
A Concerned Resident
