5. Instruction: Provide a brief summary of the passage.
5. Input:
The Waterfall Model is one of the earliest software development life cycle models. It is a linear-sequential process that is incredibly structured and often inflexible. It involves a series of distinct, non-overlapping stages that must be completed in sequence. These stages include requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. One of the advantages of the Waterfall Model is that it is easy to understand and manage. However, its inflexible nature and lack of customer involvement during development make it less suitable for modern software projects that require rapid iteration.
