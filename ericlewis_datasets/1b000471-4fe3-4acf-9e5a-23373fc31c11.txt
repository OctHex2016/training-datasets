4. Instruction: Summarize the given passage in 3-4 sentences.
4. Input: 
The human brain is a complex organ that has fascinated scientists for centuries. The brain is responsible for controlling the entire body and facilitating cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and communication. Researchers have identified about 100 billion neurons in the average human brain, which communicate with one another through electrical and chemical signals. These signals have unique patterns that allow the brain to perform various functions, including interpreting sensory information and generating responses.

10. Instruction: Explain the differences between classical conditioning and operant conditioning in psychology.
10. Input: <noinput>
10. Output: 
In psychology, classical and operant conditioning are fundamentally different learning processes. Classical conditioning involves learning by association, where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus, leading to a conditioned response. The famous example is Pavlov's dogs, where the sound of a bell (neutral stimulus) became associated with food, causing the dogs to salivate (conditioned response). On the other hand, operant conditioning focuses on learning through the consequences of behavior. Actions followed by positive consequences (reward) are likely to be repeated, while those with negative consequences (punishment) are suppressed. Operant conditioning was popularized by B.F. Skinner and his work with rats and pigeons in controlled experimental settings.

20. Instruction: Explain the greenhouse effect in simple terms.
20. Input: <noinput>
20. Output: 
The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in the atmosphere, like carbon dioxide and water vapor, trap heat radiated by the Earth. These gases, called greenhouse gases, act like a blanket around the planet, allowing sunlight to pass through but preventing some of the heat from escaping. This trapped heat warms the Earth's surface, making it habitable for life. However, increased levels of greenhouse gases due to human activities can lead to excessive warming, causing climate change.
