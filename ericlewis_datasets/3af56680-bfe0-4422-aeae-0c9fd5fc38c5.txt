4. Instruction: Summarize the given passage concisely, preserving the central theme and important points.
4. Input: 
In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made it possible for computers to carry out many tasks once thought to be uniquely human. Computers can now recognize images, understand and process speech, and even play games such as chess and Go at a level superior to human champions. These advances have led many to believe that AI will soon reach the point where it can perform virtually any task as well or better than humans. However, there are many challenges and limitations that still need to be addressed before AI can truly fulfill its potential. Some of these challenges include ensuring the safety and reliability of AI systems, addressing the ethical implications of AI-driven decision making, and designing AI systems that are capable of learning from limited data and dealing with the uncertainty inherent in many real-world tasks.
4. Output: 
Recent AI advances enable computers to perform tasks once thought to be uniquely human, such as image recognition and mastering chess. However, AI faces challenges and limitations such as ensuring safety and reliability, addressing ethical implications, and designing systems to learn from limited data and deal with uncertainty in real-world tasks.
