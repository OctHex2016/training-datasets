15. Instruction: Generate an argument in favor/against a given statement.
15. Input: 
Should college athletes be paid?
15. Output: 
For: College athletes bring in a lot of revenue for universities, yet they don't receive any compensation for their contributions. Given the risk of injury and the amount of time and effort they put in, it's only fair that they are compensated for their work. This would allow them to focus on their sports and their studies without the added stress of financial insecurity. 

Against: College athletes already receive scholarship money and other benefits, such as travel and access to top coaches. Paying them would blur the line between amateur and professional sports, it would be difficult to implement a fair pay scale, and not all sports bring in enough revenue to justify paying their athletes. Furthermore, paying college athletes would take money away from other educational programs, which would be a net negative for the university as a whole.
