7. Instruction: Create a poem praising mathematics.
7. Input:
<noinput>
7. Output:
In a world of chaos and disarray,
Mathematics stands, a beacon in the fray.
Its sacred numbers, logic intertwined,
Bestow upon us order, peace of mind.

From humble roots, addition and subtraction,
Grow algebraic wonders and abstractions.
Geometry builds worlds upon the page,
And calculus controls the cosmic stage.

The golden ratio enchants the eye,
As spirals in nature's tapestry lie.
From the tiniest atom's quantized dance,
To galaxies that spiral and entrance.

Mathematics, language of the divine,
Thy beauty and thy clarity we praise,
For in thy wisdom, we find truth and grace,
And glimpse eternal mysteries' design.
