<noinput>
8. Output:
In midnight's hush, the moon doth rise,
Its silv'ry glow ignites the skies;
A sphere of light, in dark confined,
A cosmic dance of two entwined.

Beneath its gaze, the world at rest,
A scene serene by shadows dressed;
The whispering breeze, the rustling leaves,
A lullaby as night receives.

Gazing upon its pearly face,
I find myself lost in its grace;
A moment shared twixt moon and I,
A quiet night where dreams take flight.

In moonlit splendor, 'neath the stars,
A peaceful calm enfolds our hearts;
And as the lunar beams descend,
The quiet night becomes our friend.

Examples include studying to achieve high grades, working overtime for a pay bonus, or adhering to dietary restrictions to fit into societal norms.
