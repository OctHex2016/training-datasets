As Emily unlocked her front door, she realized her keychain was missing the shiny silver key with a red heart-shaped tag. She retraced her steps, but it was nowhere to be found. That key unlocked her late grandmother's treasure chest and Emily feared it was lost forever. Later that evening, her neighbor returned it to her, saying he had found it near his mailbox. Emily hugged him gratefully, silently thanking her grandmother for keeping her treasures safe.
