4. Instruction: Summarize the following paragraph.
4. Input: 
From a historical perspective, the idea of a single, all-encompassing world order did not emerge until the early modern period. The ancient and medieval worlds were characterized by a plethora of competing and overlapping political, social, cultural and religious systems. As empires and states rose and fell, local rulers and communities vied for power and resources, and ideas and technologies circulated across wide networks of trade and communication. However, it was not until the Westphalian Peace in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War and established the principle of state sovereignty, that a clear framework for a global order began to emerge.
4. Output: 
The concept of a unified world order only emerged in the early modern period, despite numerous competing systems in ancient and medieval times. With the Westphalian Peace in 1648, which concluded the Thirty Years' War and set state sovereignty principles, a framework for global order started taking shape.
