The Spiral Jetty is a renowned earthwork sculpture created by American artist Robert Smithson in 1970. Located on the northeastern shore of the Great Salt Lake in Utah, this 1,500-foot-long and 15-foot-wide coil of rock and earth extends into the water, creating a visually captivating structure. Constructed with basalt rocks, mud, and salt crystals, the Spiral Jetty is an iconic example of Land Art, a movement that seeks to integrate natural environments and artistic expressions directly.

5. Instruction: Identify the theme of the poem.
5. Input: 
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
5. Output: 
The theme of the poem is the importance of individual choice and the impact of these choices on one's life journey.
