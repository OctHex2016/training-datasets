11. Instruction: Summarize the given text in two sentences.
11. Input:
Bees are disappearing at an alarming rate due to a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). This phenomenon occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees to care for the remaining immature bees. The cause of CCD is still not completely understood, but it’s likely a combination of factors including parasites, diseases, pesticide exposure, and malnutrition. The decline in bee populations has serious consequences for agriculture and the environment, as bees are essential pollinators for a wide variety of crops.
11. Output: 
Bees are disappearing due to Colony Collapse Disorder, where worker bees vanish from the colony, leaving only the queen and a few nurse bees. The cause is unclear, but it has significant impacts on agriculture and the environment, as bees are crucial pollinators for many crops.

<noinput>

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll, a green pigment, absorbs sunlight.

This glucose is then used by the plant for growth and energy, and the oxygen is released as a byproduct.
