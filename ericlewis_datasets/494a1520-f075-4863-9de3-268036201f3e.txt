Human evolution is the long process of development and change in which humans diverged from our primate ancestors. The process began approximately 6-7 million years ago with the Sahelanthropus tchadensis in Africa. Over long periods of time, various hominid species appeared, such as the Australopithecines, known for the famous fossil "Lucy." The Homo genus emerged around 2.8 million years ago, with Homo habilis as its first member. The path continued with Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, and finally led to Homo sapiens, our own species. Significant milestones include bipedalism, development of stone tools, cognitive advancements, and cultural complexities in communication, socialization, and problem-solving.
