14. Instruction: Explain how photosynthesis works in plants.
14. Input:
<noinput>
14. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. It occurs in plants' chloroplasts, specifically within the chlorophyll molecules. During photosynthesis, sunlight is absorbed by the chlorophyll, which then excites the electrons. This energy is then used to split water molecules, generating oxygen and hydrogen ions. Alongside this, carbon dioxide is absorbed through the plant's stomata and converted into glucose through a series of chemical reactions known as the Calvin cycle. Ultimately, photosynthesis allows plants to produce their own food and release oxygen into the atmosphere.
