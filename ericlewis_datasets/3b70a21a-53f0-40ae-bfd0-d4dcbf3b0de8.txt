10. Instruction: Describe the process of photosynthesis.
10. Input:
<noinput>
10. Output:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. It occurs in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. During the light-dependent reactions, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and converted into ATP and NADPH. In the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, ATP and NADPH are used to fix carbon dioxide (CO2) into glucose, which can be used for the organism's energy needs or stored for later use.
