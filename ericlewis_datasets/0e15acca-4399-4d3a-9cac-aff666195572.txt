First, crack 3 medium-sized eggs into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, then whisk until fully combined. In a non-stick frying pan, melt a tablespoon of butter over medium-low heat. Once the butter is melted and slightly foamy, pour in the beaten eggs. As the eggs begin to set, gently push them around the pan using a spatula, lifting and folding the mixture to create soft curds. Cook until the eggs are just set but still slightly runny, taking care not to overcook. Remove from heat, and serve your scrambled eggs immediately with toast or as desired.
