4. Instruction: Write a short summary of the given text.
4. Input:
Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are met. The first successful decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, emerged in 2009. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been created, known commonly as altcoins. While early cryptocurrency proponents believed that decentralization, transparency, and security were key to its adoption, the widespread use of cryptocurrency has been hindered by a host of issues, such as high price volatility, regulatory concerns, and the steep learning curve associated with the technology.

5. Instruction: Re-arrange and tidy up the steps of the recipe in the correct order.
5. Input:
Let the cheesecake cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, 1 cup sugar and vanilla until smooth. Preheat your oven to 350째F (180째C). Remove the cheesecake from the oven and gently run a knife around the edge of the cheesecake to loosen it from the sides of the pan. Then, place it in the refrigerator to chill for 4 hours or ideally overnight. In a separate bowl, beat heavy cream and 1/4 cup sugar until stiff peaks form; fold into cream cheese mixture. Pour into the prepared crust and place the cheesecake in the oven. First, lightly coat a 9-inch springform pan with non-stick spray and set aside. After, spread evenly and press gently into the bottom of the prepared pan, then refrigerate while you prepare the filling. Bake crust for 10 minutes, cool completely on a wire rack.

6. Instruction: List the main differences between mitosis and meiosis in regard to their processes and results.
6. Input:
<noinput>
6. Output:
1. Function: Mitosis is involved in growth, tissue repair, and asexual reproduction. Meiosis is involved in sexual reproduction, producing gametes.
2. Phases: Mitosis has only one division (completed in prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase). Meiosis has two divisions, Meiosis I and Meiosis II.
3. Daughter cells: Mitosis produces 2 daughter cells, each identical to the parent cell. Meiosis produces 4 daughter cells, each genetically different.
4. Chromosome number: Daughter cells in mitosis have the same chromosome number as the parent cell (diploid). In meiosis, daughter cells have half the number of chromosomes (haploid).
5. Genetic variation: Mitosis results in genetically identical cells. Meiosis results in genetically diverse cells due to crossing over during Prophase I and independent assortment during Metaphase I.

7. Instruction: Answer the philosophical question with a well-reasoned response.
7. Input:
Do we have free will or is everything determined by fate?
7. Output:
The debate on free will versus determinism is ongoing and complex. Proponents of free will argue that humans have the ability to make choices and influence events independently, while determinists maintain that everything is predetermined by factors beyond human control, such as genetics or environment. Some philosophers propose a middle ground known as compatibilism, in which an individual's actions are influenced by both free will and determinism. Ultimately, the question remains unresolved, and it is up to each person to explore their understanding and beliefs regarding the balance between free will and fate.
