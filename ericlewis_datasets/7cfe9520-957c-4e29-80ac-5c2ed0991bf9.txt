5. Instruction: Provide a summary of the article.
5. Input: 
In a new research article published in the journal Nature, scientists have reported a breakthrough in battery technology which could revolutionize electric vehicle charging. The lithium-ion-based solid-state system developed at Harvard University has the potential to charge an electric vehicle in as little as 10 minutes. This would resolve the longstanding issue of long charging durations faced by electric vehicles, which has been a major barrier to widespread adoption. Additionally, the new technology appears to be safer, cleaner, and capable of holding up to ten times more energy than current lithium-ion batteries. Experts predict a rapid surge in demand for electric vehicles if this breakthrough is successfully commercialized.
