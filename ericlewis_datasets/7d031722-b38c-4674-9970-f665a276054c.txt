A solar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon that occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, temporarily blocking the Sun's light from reaching the Earth. This event can be visible from certain locations on Earth, causing daylight to turn into darkness for a short period of time. Solar eclipses happen during a new moon, when the Moon is in direct alignment with the Sun relative to the Earth. There are different types of solar eclipses, including total, partial, and annular eclipses, which vary based on the degree of coverage by the Moon's shadow on the Earth's surface.
