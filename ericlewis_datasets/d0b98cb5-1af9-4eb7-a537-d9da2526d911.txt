Poem: 
Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening 
BY ROBERT FROST
Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound’s the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
10. Output:
The main theme of this poem is the struggle between obligations and the desire for peace and rest. The speaker stops to admire the beauty of the snowy woods but ultimately feels compelled to continue on their journey. This theme is significant because it is a common experience people can relate to in their own lives, of having responsibilities and duties that may make it difficult to take a moment to appreciate beauty and stillness.
