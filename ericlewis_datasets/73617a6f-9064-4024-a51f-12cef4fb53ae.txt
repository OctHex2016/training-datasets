9. Input: 
<noinput>
9. Output: 
The Ocean Guardian is a solar-powered, floating vessel that autonomously patrols the ocean to collect and compact plastic waste. Equipped with advanced AI programming and sensors, it can detect and navigate areas with high concentrations of plastic debris. Additionally, the Ocean Guardian features a "plastic netting" system that efficiently captures floating plastic while minimizing harm to marine life. Once full, the vessel returns to a nearby collection station where the compacted plastic is offloaded, ready for recycling or proper disposal. The Ocean Guardian fleet aims to progressively reduce the adverse impact of plastic waste on our ocean ecosystems.
