15. Instruction: Explain the cause of the historical event.
15. Input: 
The Great Depression
15. Output: 
The Great Depression was caused by several factors, including an economic imbalance, a stock market crash, and high tariffs. A speculative bubble led to the stock market crash of 1929, which wiped out vast amounts of wealth and severely damaged investor confidence. Bank failures led to a reduction in the money supply, and limited access to credit deepened the economic decline. Fiscal policies, such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, stifled international trade and further exacerbated the economic crisis. Unemployment rates skyrocketed, and widespread poverty ensued, lasting until the late 1930s and early 1940s when economic policies and wartime efforts helped lift the economy.
