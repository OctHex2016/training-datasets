"The productivity of remote work has been a hotly debated topic ever since the Covid-19 pandemic forced businesses and organizations to close their offices. Some employees have found that they are more productive working from home, while others struggle to focus without the office environment. A new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that remote workers are more likely to put in longer hours, but their focus deteriorates. Researchers found that workers' focus is greatest when they are in a shared work environment, even when factoring in the distractions that come with working in an office. The researchers suggested that factors such as the lack of manager oversight, the blurred boundaries between work and personal time, and the absence of scheduled breaks contributed to the decline in focus."
