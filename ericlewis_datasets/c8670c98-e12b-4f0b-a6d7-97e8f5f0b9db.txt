7. Instruction: Create a sonnet about loneliness.
7. Input: 
<noinput>
7. Output: 
In shadowed halls, where echoes coldly dwell,
I wander mid' the silence, lost to time,
A form unloved, from friendships cast aside,
Forlorn within my self-inflicted cell.

No cherished laughter. Spirits to dispel,
No solace whispered through the autumn rime,
In solitude, I weave a lonesome rhyme
And shun the joy, yet also shun the knell.

Perchance, this icy fortress I did build,
To shield my battered heart from tender pain,
Yet solitude itself, to pain a friend,
My spirit mourns, my vibrant youth unspilled.

O, dare the light to banish shadow's bane,
And warmth of love to guide this journey's end.
