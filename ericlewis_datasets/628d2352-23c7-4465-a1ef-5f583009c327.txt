17. Input: 
<noinput>
17. Output: 
A rainbow forms when sunlight interacts with raindrops in the atmosphere. Sunlight is composed of various colors (wavelengths) of light. When sunlight enters a raindrop, the light is refracted, which causes the colors to separate. The light then reflects off the inner surface of the raindrop and refracts again as it exits, further bending and dispersing the colors. When these separated colors reach an observer's eyes at the right angles, they create the appearance of a multicolored arc, known as a rainbow.

19. Instruction: Explain the Doppler effect in simple terms.
19. Input: 
<noinput>
19. Output: 
The Doppler effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a source of waves (such as sound, light, or radio waves) is moving relative to an observer. As the source moves towards the observer, the waves become compressed, causing the frequency and pitch (for sound waves) to increase. When the source moves away from the observer, the waves become stretched, causing the frequency and pitch to decrease. This is why a passing ambulance's siren seems to change pitch as it approaches and recedes.
