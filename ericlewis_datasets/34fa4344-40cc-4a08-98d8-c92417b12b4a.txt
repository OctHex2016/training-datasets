5. Instruction: Explain the difference between absolute and relative humidity.
5. Input: 
<noinput>
5. Output: 
Absolute humidity is the actual amount of water vapor present in a specific volume of air, generally expressed in grams per cubic meter. Relative humidity, on the other hand, is the ratio of the current amount of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum amount of water vapor the air could hold at a given temperature, expressed as a percentage. Relative humidity is dependent on both the moisture content and the air temperature, while absolute humidity only considers the moisture content.

9. Instruction: Write a brief summary of the article below.
9. Input: 
Scientists at the University of California have made a breakthrough in the field of artificial photosynthesis, developing a new process that could potentially turn carbon dioxide (CO2) into useful organic compounds, such as plastics and fuels. Using a unique nanowire-bacteria hybrid system, this process imitates natural photosynthesis and converts sunlight, water, and CO2 into the desired chemical products. The researchers believe that this technology could help mitigate climate change by reducing the increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and supporting the development of renewable energy solutions.
