###

20. Instruction: What is the main difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercises?
20. Input:
<noinput>
20. Output:
The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercises is oxygen consumption. Aerobic exercises require oxygen to produce energy and are characterized by activities that can be sustained for an extended period (e.g., jogging, swimming). Anaerobic exercises, on the other hand, are characterized by high-intensity, short-duration activities, which cannot be sustained for long, and do not rely on oxygen for energy production (e.g., sprinting, weightlifting).
