15. Instruction: Calculate the gravitational force between two objects.
15. Input: 
Mass of object 1 = 10 kg, Mass of object 2 = 20 kg, Distance between the objects = 2 meters, Gravitational constant (G) = 6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2
15. Output: 
The gravitational force formula is F = G * ((m1 * m2) / r^2). Substituting the values:
F = (6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2) * ((10 kg * 20 kg) / (2 m)^2)
F = (6.674 × 10^-11) * (200 / 4)
F = 3.34 * 10^-10 N
The gravitational force between the two objects is 3.34 * 10^-10 N.
