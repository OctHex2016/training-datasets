4. Instruction: Write a brief summary of the passage highlighting the main points.
4. Input: 
The Montessori Method is an educational approach developed by Italian physician and educator Maria Montessori in 1907, whose teaching methods focus on the holistic and self-directed development of the child. The method encourages an environment in which the child learns through discovery, rather than through direct instruction.  Montessori classrooms are designed to foster independence, responsibility, and a love for learning. The classroom materials, the role of adults, and the physical environment are all intentionally prepared to support this method. One distinct feature of Montessori education is its use of "sensitive periods," when children's brains are especially receptive to mastering particular skills, and the Montessori curriculum is designed to capitalize on these sensitive periods.

5. Instruction: Provide a short explanation about how the immune system works.
5. Input: 
<noinput>
5. Output: 
The immune system protects the body from harmful substances like bacteria, viruses, and toxins. It consists of various cells, tissues, and organs working together. The immune system is divided into two parts: innate (non-specific) and adaptive (specific) immunity. Innate immunity provides the first line of defense, including physical barriers like skin and mucous membranes, and cells like neutrophils and macrophages that engulf and destroy pathogens. Adaptive immunity involves specific cells (lymphocytes) that can recognize and target specific pathogens. These cells include B cells, which produce antibodies, and T cells, which help eliminate infected cells. The immune system's components work together to identify, attack, and eliminate foreign substances and remember them for future encounters, ensuring a quicker and stronger response.
