10. Instruction: Provide a brief summary of the given article's main points.
10. Input: 
A newly published research paper suggests that CBD, a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis, could help in the treatment of anxiety and related disorders. The research, conducted by a team of scientists from the University of São Paulo, analyzed existing studies on the subject and concluded that CBD has shown promise as a treatment for anxiety.

The scientists pointed out that CBD appears to have anti-anxiety effects and does not trigger the intoxicating effects associated with THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana. This makes it an appealing option for those seeking a way to manage anxiety without experiencing inebriation. Although the findings are preliminary, the researchers maintain that the potential therapeutic properties of CBD warrant further exploration into its benefits for mental health.
