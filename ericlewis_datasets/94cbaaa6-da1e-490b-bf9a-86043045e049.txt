4. Instruction: Summarize the following news article without including any personal opinions.
4. Input: 
More than three-quarters of older American adults are expected to be living in single-person households by 2040, according to predictions. The increase is due, in part, to longer life expectancy, as well as the rise in divorce and a tendency for subsequent marriages to end in the same way. This shift could put more pressure on healthcare providers and caregiving services. Loneliness, which often accompanies older adults living alone, can be a risk factor for mental and physical health issues.

By 2040, over 75% of older American adults are predicted to live in single-person households, due to factors such as increased life expectancy and higher divorce rates. This may lead to increased strain on healthcare and caregiving services, and raise concerns about loneliness-related health risks for older adults living alone.
