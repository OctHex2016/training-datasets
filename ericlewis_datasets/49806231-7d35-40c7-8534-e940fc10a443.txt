4. Output: 
In nature's tapestry, hues unfold,
Vibrant greens, fiery reds, and calming gold.
Majestic mountains touch the sky,
As cotton clouds gently float by.

Birds in chorus sing sweet melodies,
A symphony amidst the rustling trees.
Gentle rivers weave and wander,
Through echoing forests where thoughts can ponder.

Nature's beauty, a gift to embrace,
As seasons change, its wonders replace.
