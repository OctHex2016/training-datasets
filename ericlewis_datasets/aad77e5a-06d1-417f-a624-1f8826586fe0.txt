Jellyfish are fascinating creatures that inhabit every ocean. These animals come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Equipped with a soft, gelatinous body and a unique structure, they lack the traditional features such as bones, muscles, and fins. However, this does not hinder their ability to move about the oceans. Instead, they use a pulsing motion to propel themselves through the water.
