4. Instruction: Explain the working principle of a solar panel.
4. Input: <noinput>
4. Output: 
Solar panels are made of photovoltaic (PV) cells, which convert sunlight into direct current (DC) electricity. When sunlight hits the solar panel, photons in the sunlight knock electrons loose from atoms in the PV cells. The movement of these electrons creates an electric current. The DC electricity produced by the PV cells is then converted into alternating current (AC) electricity by an inverter. Finally, the AC electricity can be used to power your home or sent back to the electrical grid.
