10. Instruction: Describe how combustion works.
10. Input: 
<noinput>
10. Output: 
Combustion is a chemical reaction between a fuel and an oxidizing agent, typically oxygen, that releases energy in the form of heat and light. For combustion to occur, three elements must be present: fuel, oxygen, and heat. The fuel can be a substance like gasoline or wood, while the heat serves as an ignition source. When these elements combine under specific conditions, the heat breaks the chemical bond in the fuel, releasing stored energy. This energy then reacts with oxygen, forming new compounds like carbon dioxide and water, along with heat and light, which are usually visible as a flame. The process continues until the fuel is exhausted or oxygen is depleted.
