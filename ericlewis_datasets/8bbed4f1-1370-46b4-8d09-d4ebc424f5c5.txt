###
8. Instruction: Find the internal inconsistencies within the given statement.
8. Input:
Aliens from space have been observing Earth for centuries, yet they have never bothered to make contact due to their shy nature. They don't want to frighten us, and they are very disappointed when they see conspiracy theories claiming that they plan to invade our planet and destroy humanity.
8. Output:
Inconsistency 1: If aliens have been observing Earth for centuries, it is inconsistent with them being shy and not wanting to frighten us since they know that people are aware of their existence due to conspiracy theories.
Inconsistency 2: If aliens do not want to make contact due to their shy nature, it doesn't make sense that they would become disappointed when conspiracy theories claim they plan to invade our planet. Shy beings would prefer not to be noticed at all.

11. Input:
Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity today. It is primarily caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the Earth's atmosphere, which leads to global warming. The primary culprit for producing these gases is the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. As a result, there's been a push to transition to renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydro power. These clean, sustainable energy sources can help reduce GHG emissions and combat climate change.
