7. Instruction: Explain how Photosynthesis works.
7. Input: <noinput>
7. Output: 
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O) into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen (O2). This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where the green pigment chlorophyll absorbs sunlight energy. The absorbed energy allows the plant to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a waste product, while the hydrogen combines with carbon dioxide to form glucose. The glucose serves as an energy source for the plant, enabling growth, repair, and reproduction.
