4. Instruction: Summarize the following passage in one sentence.
4. Input: 
Passive solar design refers to the use of the sun's energy to heat and cool living spaces in a building. This design strategy takes advantage of building elements such as windows, walls, and floors to absorb, store, and release solar energy in the form of heat, thus passively providing thermal comfort to the occupants throughout the year. It can be as simple as incorporating strategically placed windows that let in natural light and manage heat gain, or more complex, involving earth sheltering, thermal mass, and other building materials and techniques.
4. Output: 
Passive solar design utilizes the sun's energy and strategic building elements to heat and cool living spaces, providing thermal comfort year-round through methods such as windows for natural light and heat management or advanced techniques like earth sheltering and thermal mass.
