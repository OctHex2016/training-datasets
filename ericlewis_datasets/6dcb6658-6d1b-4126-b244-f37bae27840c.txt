10. Instruction: Explain the Pythagorean theorem and its significance in mathematics.
10. Input:
<noinput>
10. Output: 
The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry, stating that for a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Mathematically, it can be represented as a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the triangle's legs and c is the hypotenuse's length. The theorem is attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, but it was known to other civilizations before him. It is significant in mathematics because it forms the basis for trigonometry, and engineering and design applications. It also has implications in algebra, calculus, and other mathematical fields.
