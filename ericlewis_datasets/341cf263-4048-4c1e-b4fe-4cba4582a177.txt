Dear Mr. Thompson,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the possibility of upgrading my order for the upcoming conference on sustainable living. I originally requested a standard booth, but I now realize that my company, GreenHome Solutions, would greatly benefit from a larger, premium booth to better showcase our eco-friendly home products.

Would it be possible to change our booking and reserve a premium booth for the event? I understand that there may be additional costs associated with the upgrade, and I am prepared to cover any such charges. Kindly let me know if this change can be accommodated and what the revised total would be.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
